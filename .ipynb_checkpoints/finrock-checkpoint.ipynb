After meeting Kaitlyn at a bar in Louisiana, he says they\\'ve been inseparable, and one night, when she caught him staring, he called her, \"My future wife.\"\\n\\nMoments later, he proposed without a ring, and twelve hours after that, they said \"I do\" at the Little Chapel of Hearts.\\n\\nMonty and Sheri first married in 2004, welcomed Addison the following year, and later had two sons, Enzo and Lucas. They divorced once during Addison\\'s childhood but rekindled their romance and remarried in 2017 after Addison\\'s TikTok fame.\\n\\nThings ended again in 2022 when cheating allegations against Monty surfaced ... leading to another public breakup. Sheri later made headlines for her short-lived fling with rapper Yung Gravy, even sharing a kiss on the MTV VMAs red carpet.'},\n",

This session, it added cinemas in North America and another $14.7M from 46 offshore Sony markets.\\n\\nProduced by MAPPA, the story of demon hunter Denji is now at a global Sony cume of $60.4M ($43.1M international, $17.25M domestic). Toho releases in Japan.\\n\\nEurope and Latin America leaned in this frame, while Korea continues to embrace the movie – now at $18.8M through today.\\n\\nWatch on Deadline\\n\\nAlso in continued play, Blumhouse/Universal’s Black Phone 2 rang up another $10.5M for a $31.4M international cume to date in 74 markets. That’s in line with The Black Phone at the same point in release. Global is $80.4M after two weekends.\\n\\nMexico continues to dial in, reaching $7.8M to surpass the lifetimes of A Quiet Place Part II, 28 Years Later, Halloween Ends, Smile 2 and Sinners.\\n\\nBehind Mexico, the Top 5 is rounded out by UK ($3.1M), Brazil ($2.2M), Australia ($1.8M) and France ($1.3M).\\n\\nStill to come are Korea and Japan.\\n\\nFrom Paramount, Colleen Hoover’s Regretting You swayed to a $10M debut in an initial 43 markets.\\n\\nOn a like-for-like basis that’s 10% above Where the Crawdads Sing and 23% above Challengers.\\n\\nThe Top 5 starts out of the 77% international footprint are UK ($1.75M), Germany ($1.65M), Australia ($1.4M), Mexico ($1.3M) and Brazil ($745K).\\n\\nAmid another small drop (-34%), Paul Thomas Anderson’s critical darling One Battle After Another brought in another $8M overseas this session, from 76 markets. The offshore cume to date is $114.2M and the global total is $180M through Sunday.\\n\\nNew this frame was also 20th Century/Disney’s Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere. The Boss biopic grossed $7M from 28 material offshore markets, led by the UK ($1.6M at No. 1) and Germany ($1M). The global take was $16.1M. While Bruce is a god to so, so many of us (I include my New Jersey-born self), this is not expected to be a movie that travels greatly. It still has Brazil, Japan and Korea as well as most smaller Asian and all smaller Latin American territories to go.

It also omitted that Reagan recorded the address after imposing duties on some Japanese products. A duty is a tax imposed on goods; a tariff is a type of duty imposed on imported or exported goods.\\n\\nThe Reagan Foundation said the Canadian ad — which featured Reagan’s April 25, 1987, radio address — used “selective audio and video” and “mispresents the Presidential Radio Address.”\\n\\nTrump wrote, “The Ronald Reagan Foundation has just announced that Canada has fraudulently used an advertisement, which is FAKE, featuring Ronald Reagan speaking negatively about Tariffs.” The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is a nonprofit based in Simi Valley, Calif., created by Reagan to advance his legacy and principles.\\n\\nIn an Oct. 23 Truth Social post, Trump referenced a statement from The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute.\\n\\nAfter the government of the Canadian province of Ontario released an anti-tariff ad taking aim at U.S. trade policy, President Donald Trump said the United States was cutting off trade negotiations with its northern neighbor.\\n\\nHowever, the ad’s overall message doesn’t misrepresent Reagan’s views on tariffs. Reagan said he believed that in the long-term tariffs would lead to trade wars and hurt Americans.\\n\\nWe asked the Reagan Foundation how the ad misrepresented Reagan’s address, but we did not receive a response by publication.\\n\\nWhen we asked the White House what was fake about the ad, spokesperson Kush Desai said, “Even The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute is calling out Ontario’s misleading and selective editing of President Reagan’s remarks.”\\n\\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said Oct. 14 that a $75 million ad buy was planned and would air on major networks. On Oct. 24 — after Trump canceled trade talks with Canada — Ford said the ad would continue to air during the first two World Series games but will pause after that, “so that trade talks can resume.”\\n\\nThe clips from Reagan’s address used in the ad\\n\\nThe ad shows Reagan delivering the address. In the ad, he says:\\n\\n“When someone says, ‘Let’s impose tariffs on foreign imports,’ it looks like they’re doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And, sometimes for a short while, it works, but only for a short time. But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.\\n\\n“High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens: markets shrink and collapse, businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.\\n\\n“Throughout the world, there’s a growing realization that the way to prosperity for all nations is rejecting protectionist legislation and promoting fair and free competition. America’s jobs and growth are at stake.”\\n\\nSome sentences in the ad are not in the same order as Reagan delivered them, but the reordering did not change his meaning. (The sentence, “But over the long run, such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer,” was actually delivered earlier in Reagan’s remarks. The ad also edited in the word “but.” Reagan said, “And in a moment I’ll mention the sound economic reasons for this: that over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.”)\\n\\nWATCH: Trump considers $10 billion bailout for farmers as tariffs disrupt the market\\n\\nIn its edit, the ad also omitted additional comments Reagan made in the same address. Reagan also said that he had recently placed new duties on some Japanese products because Japan had not been enforcing a trade agreement on semiconductors. Reagan said he would discuss trade disagreements with Japan’s Prime Minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, at the White House the week after the address.\\n\\nReagan framed the action against Japan as an unusual case of leveraging trade policies to counteract specific behavior by one trading partner on one group of products.\\n\\nIn another part of the address not quoted in the ad, Reagan said the actions involving “Japanese semiconductors were a special case” to “deal with a particular problem, not begin a trade war.”\\n\\nReagan also said, “Now, imposing such tariffs or trade barriers and restrictions of any kind are steps that I am loath to take.”\\n\\nHe said the result of a trade war would be “more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying.”\\n\\nAd did not capture additional Reagan tariff history\\n\\nLike the address, Reagan’s overall trade record often supported free trade, but was at times nuanced.\\n\\nReagan pushed for several international free-trade agreements, including the 1988 U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which later incorporated Mexico and evolved into the North American Free Trade Agreement.\\n\\nReagan’s administration “launched the most comprehensive set of global trade-barrier-reducing negotiations yet completed — the Uruguay Round, which eventually established the World Trade Organization,” I.M. Destler, a University of Maryland public policy professor, told us in 2016; Destler died in 2025. That negotiation continued under President George H.W. Bush and was concluded and ratified, with large bipartisan margins, under President Bill Clinton.\\n\\nIn a 1985 address to business leaders, Reagan said, “Our trade policy rests firmly on the foundation of free and open markets — free trade.”\\n\\nHe also spoke about the merits and drawbacks of free trade. “I believe that if trade is not fair for all, then trade is free in name only,” he said. “I will not stand by and watch American businesses fail because of unfair trading practices abroad. I will not stand by and watch American workers lose their jobs because other nations do not play by the rules.”\\n\\nReagan sometimes bent to public pressure for more protectionist measures, as he did with Japanese semiconductors.\\n\\nIn 1982, Reagan imposed quotas on sugar, which resulted in higher prices. His administration negotiated more stringent provisions for textile and apparel imports, though not as tight as the industry wanted. And the administration set import quotas on machine tools from South Korea and imposed tariffs on Canadian lumber.\\n\\nHis most significant protectionist trade moves were a pair of “voluntary export restraints” on steel and on cars. These policies limited how many units foreign producers could ship to the United States, giving domestic producers some breathing room from foreign competition so they could retool their businesses. (The policies also raised prices for U.S. consumers and sometimes led to shortages.)\\n\\nOur ruling\\n\\nThe Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Institute said Ontario’s ad “misrepresents” Reagan’s 1987 address about tariffs.\\n\\nThe ad edits together some sentences from a 1987 address, and it leaves out that in the address, Reagan said he would levy duties on some Japanese products.\\n\\nHowever, Reagan’s address framed the actions against Japan as exceptions to his general support of free trade, a position he championed not only in the parts quoted in the ad but also throughout much of the address.\\n\\nWe rate this statement Mostly False.'},\n",

According to TMZ, the couple made their first official public appearance together in Paris to celebrate Perry’s 41st birthday, marking the first time they’ve gone public as a couple.The relationship confirmation follows months of public sightings, sources’ comments, and growing social media buzz about their connection, from Montreal strolls to yacht getaways. Here’s a full timeline of how Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau’s romance unfolded. Take a look.On July 28, Perry and Trudeau were seen spending the day together in Montreal’s Mount Royal Park, sparking initial rumors about their relationship. TMZ obtained photos of the two smiling and chatting as they took a walk through the park.Later that day, the pair were filmed having dinner at Le Violon. In footage obtained by TMZ, Perry and Trudeau appeared to be deep in conversation, with the singer looking attentively at Trudeau. The video went viral and the speculations began.Danny Smiles, Le Violon’s co-owner and co-executive chef who served them, told TMZ that there were no romantic gestures during the meal.“He didn’t get any dating vibes from Katy and Justin... just two friends enjoying a meal,” Smiles said.After dinner, the pair headed to Taverne Atlantic for drinks, rounding off a long day together that would set off a wave of dating speculation.Just two days later, Trudeau was seen in the audience at Katy Perry’s Lifetimes Tour stop in Montreal.Fans recorded footage of him singing along to “Firework,” with his daughter Ella-Grace Trudeau also attending the concert. The sighting fueled more rumors that the two were spending time together beyond friendly outings.By early August, reports from People confirmed that Perry and Trudeau’s connection was indeed romantic — but still developing.“They are interested in each other, but it will take a while to see where this goes,” a source told People. “She is traveling around the world, and he is figuring out his life now that he is no longer prime minister of Canada, but there is an attraction. They have a lot in common.”The insider added, “Music is one of many things they can share. Both are idealists and still live in a world where they think they can make improvements, although it has gotten more difficult.”The source also explained that both have full lives and parental responsibilities, which could slow things down. “Their own personal responsibilities could make this relationship move slower than it would, but there are ways to see the other and still fulfill their parenting responsibilities,” they said.A second source told People, “Justin is a [politician] who is used to living a secret life with his personal activity, and wouldn’t put on a public display at this stage. He knows they were being watched and is smart enough to play it low-key for now.”In September, Us Weekly reported that Perry and Trudeau were still seeing each other but had decided to be more discreet.“They’ve decided to be much more private about it,” a source told US Weekly. “They are still speaking and are very interested in each other.”Another insider noted that the relationship “isn’t serious,” but that they planned to reunite soon. “Justin has made plans to see her when she has downtime in a few weeks when she gets back from her tour in Brazil,” the source said. “Katy is taking it day by day but is very open to dating.”Their rumored romance became undeniable on October 11, when The Daily Mail published exclusive photos of the two kissing aboard Perry’s yacht, The Caravelle, off the coast of Santa Barbara, California.In the images, Perry was seen in a black swimsuit, while Trudeau appeared shirtless, wearing only pants. The photos quickly went viral, confirming what had been weeks of speculation. Love was in the air, and the spark really reflected.During her Lifetimes Tour performance on October 13 in London, England, Perry appeared to acknowledge her new relationship in front of fans.“What does your sign say?” she asked a fan in the audience. When the fan shouted back, “I heard you’re single?” Perry responded, “You heard I was single? That’s interesting.”The fan then came on stage holding a sign that read, “Katy Perry, will you marry me?” and dropped to one knee. Perry laughed and said, “I couldn’t read that high up! Are you kidding me? Not today! You know you really should have asked me about 48 hours ago,” she teased, a comment that fans interpreted as a nod to the yacht photos published just two days prior.Perry subtly confirmed her new relationship online when fans noticed that she liked a satirical post from The Onion that joked about her “Canadian manufacturing era.”The post was widely seen as a playful reference to her budding romance with the former Canadian leader.Finally, the relationship went public on October 25, as Perry celebrated her 41st birthday with Trudeau in Paris, officially confirming their romance. The couple were clicked holding hands.According to TMZ, the couple attended a cabaret show at Crazy Horse Paris, where they were photographed holding hands and smiling while leaving the venue. Trudeau was seen escorting her to the car, dressed in a black suit, while Katy wore a red dress.Fans gathered outside, singing “Happy Birthday” to Katy as one handed her a bouquet of roses.'},\n",

The prospect of a widening conflict risked weakening economic growth worldwide.\\n\\nChina’s top trade negotiator, Li Chenggang, told reporters the two sides had reached a “preliminary consensus,” while Trump’s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said there was “a very successful framework.”\\n\\nTrump also expressed confidence that an agreement was at hand, saying the Chinese “want to make a deal and we want to make a deal.” The Republican president is set to meet with Xi on Thursday in South Korea, the final stop of his trip through Asia.\\n\\nBessent told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that the threat of additional higher tariffs on China was “effectively off the table.” In interviews on several American news shows, he said discussions with China yielded initial agreements to stop the precursor chemicals for fentanyl from coming into the U.S., and that Beijing would make “substantial” purchases of soybean and other agricultural products while putting off export controls on rare earths.\\n\\nWhen asked how close a deal was, Trump’s trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said on “Fox News Sunday” that “it’s really going to depend” on the two presidents.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Trump reiterated that he plans to visit China in the future and suggested that Xi could come to Washington or Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private club in Florida.\\n\\nThe progress toward a potential agreement came during the annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, in Kuala Lumpur, with Trump seeking to burnish his reputation as an international dealmaker.\\n\\nYet his way of pursuing deals has meant serious disruptions at home and abroad. His import taxes have scrambled relationships with trading partners while a U.S. government shutdown has him feuding with Democrats.\\n\\nTrump attends ceasefire ceremony between Thailand and Cambodia\\n\\nAt the summit, Thailand and Cambodia signed an expanded ceasefire agreement during a ceremony attended by Trump. His threats of economic pressure prodded the two nations to halt skirmishes along their disputed border earlier this year.\\n\\nThailand will release Cambodian prisoners and Cambodia will begin withdrawing heavy artillery as part of the first phase of the deal. Regional observers will monitor the situation to ensure fighting doesn’t restart.\\n\\n“We did something that a lot of people said couldn’t be done,” Trump said. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet called it a “historic day,” and Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said the agreement creates “the building blocks for a lasting peace.”\\n\\nThe president signed economic frameworks with Cambodia, Thailand and Malaysia, some of them aimed at increasing trade involving critical minerals. The United States wants to rely less on China, which has used limits on exports of key components in technology manufacturing as a bargaining chip in trade talks.\\n\\n“It’s very important that we cooperate as willing partners with each other to ensure that we can have smooth supply chains, secure supply chains, for the quality of life, for our people and security,” Greer said.\\n\\nTrump reengages with a key region of the world\\n\\nTrump attended this summit only once during his first term, and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth seemed unfamiliar with ASEAN during his confirmation hearing in January.\\n\\nThis year’s event was a chance for Trump to reengage with nations that have a combined $3.8 trillion economy and 680 million people.\\n\\n“The United States is with you 100%, and we intend to be a strong partner and friend for many generations to come,” Trump said. He described his counterparts as “spectacular leaders” and said that “everything you touch turns to gold.”\\n\\nTrump’s tariff threats were credited with helping spur negotiations between Thailand and Cambodia. Some of the worst modern fighting between the two countries took place over five days in July, killing dozens and displacing hundreds of thousands of people.\\n\\nThe president threatened, at the time, to withhold trade agreements unless the fighting stopped. A shaky truce has persisted since then.\\n\\nMalaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim praised the agreement between Thailand and Cambodia, saying at the summit that “it reminds us that reconciliation is not concession, but an act of courage.”\\n\\nTariffs are in focus on Trump’s trip\\n\\nTrump in Kuala Lumpur met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was also attending the summit. There has been friction between them over Brazil’s prosecution of Jair Bolsonaro, the country’s former president and a close Trump ally. Bolsonaro was convicted last month of attempting to overturn election results in his country.\\n\\nDuring their meeting, Trump said he could reduce tariffs on Brazil that he enacted in a push for leniency for Bolsonaro.\\n\\n“I think we should be able to make some good deals for both countries,” he said.\\n\\nWhile Trump was warming to Lula, he avoided Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. The president is angry with Canada because of a television advertisement protesting his trade policies, and on his way to the summit announced on social media he would raise tariffs on Canada because of it.\\n\\nOne leader absent from the summit was Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Although he was close with Trump during Trump’s first term, the relationship has been more tense lately. Trump caused irritation by boasting that he settled a recent conflict between India and Pakistan, and he has increased tariffs on India for its purchase of Russian oil.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writers Josh Boak in Tokyo and Jintamas Saksornchai in Bangkok contributed to this report.'},\n",

Valery Gerasimov, Russia\\'s chief of general staff, who told the Russian leader that the Burevestnik covered 14,000 kilometers (8,700 miles) in a key test Tuesday.\\n\\nGerasimov said the Burevestnik, or storm petrel in Russian, spent 15 hours in the air, adding \"that\\'s not the limit.\"\\n\\nLittle is known about the Burevestnik, which was code-named Skyfall by NATO, and many Western experts have been skeptical about it, noting that a nuclear engine could be highly unreliable.\\n\\nIn this image made from video released by the Russian Presidential Press Office on Sunday, Oct. 26, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks while visiting one of the command posts of the Joint Group of Forces. Russian Presidential Press Office via AP\\n\\nWhen Putin first revealed that Russia was working on the weapon in his 2018 state-of-the-nation address, he claimed it would have an unlimited range, allowing it to circle the globe undetected by missile defense systems.\\n\\nMany observers argue that such a missile could be difficult to handle and pose an environmental threat. The U.S. and the Soviet Union worked on nuclear-powered missiles during the Cold War, but they eventually shelved the projects, considering them too hazardous.\\n\\nThe Burevestnik reportedly suffered an explosion in August 2019 during tests at a navy range on the White Sea, killing five nuclear engineers and two service members and resulting in a brief spike in radioactivity that fueled fears in a nearby city.\\n\\nRussian officials never identified the weapon involved, but the U.S. said it was the Burevestnik.\\n\\n\"We need to determine the possible uses and begin preparing the infrastructure for deploying these weapons to our armed forces,\" Putin told Gerasimov.\\n\\nThe Russian leader also claimed it was invulnerable to current and future missile defenses, due to its almost unlimited range and unpredictable flight path.\\n\\nKirill Dmitriev, a top Putin aide who was in the U.S. as the video surfaced, said his delegation informed U.S. colleagues of the \"successful testing\" of the Burevestnik, which he said was an \"absolutely new class\" of weapon.\\n\\nEarlier this week, Putin directed drills of Russia\\'s strategic nuclear forces that featured practice missile launches. The exercise came as his planned summit on Ukraine with U.S. President Trump was put on hold.\\n\\nThe Kremlin said that the maneuvers involved all parts of Moscow\\'s nuclear triad, including intercontinental ballistic missiles that were test-fired from launch facilities in northwestern Russia and a submarine in the Barents Sea. The drills also involved Tu-95 strategic bombers firing long-range cruise missiles.\\n\\nThe exercise tested the skills of military command structures, the Kremlin said in a statement on Wednesday.'},\n",

Gavin Newsom said in an interview on “CBS News Sunday Morning” that he would be “lying” if he denied plans to consider a presidential bid.\\n\\nAsked whether it would be fair to say he would give a presidential bid “serious thought” after the midterm elections, the governor agreed.\\n\\n“Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise,” said Newsom, a Democrat. “I’d just be lying, and I can’t do that.”\\n\\nNewsom has become a leading voice in the opposition to President Donald Trump, slamming the administration’s handling of issues such as National Guard deployments and immigration raids. He is ineligible to run for re-election as governor in 2026 due to term limits.\\n\\nHis comments come as Democrats have struggled to find a path forward amid low approval ratings. With Republicans in control of the White House, House and Senate, polling this year has indicated that most Democratic voters want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions rather than to seek compromise.\\n\\nThe governor has previously said he would need to have a “why” if he decided to run for president.\\n\\nAsked by CBS News whether he was closer to finding his reason for running — his “why” — Newsom said that if someone has “a compelling ‘why,’ you can endure any ‘how.’”\\n\\n“I think the biggest challenge for anyone who runs for any office is people see right through you. If you don’t have that ‘why,’ you’re doing it for the wrong reasons,” he said.\\n\\n“Fate will determine that,” he added.\\n\\nOther potential 2028 candidates have begun indicating their openness to a presidential bid. During an interview with the BBC on Saturday, former Vice President Kamala Harris appeared to open the door to another campaign. After Harris said that her nieces would see a female president in their lifetimes, she was asked whether it could be her.\\n\\n“Possibly,” Harris said, also saying during the interview that “I am not done.”\\n\\nNewsom has forcefully pushed back on the Trump administration, frequently mocking the president on social media while the state government has sued the president over multiple National Guard moves. The Trump administration, in turn, has targeted California, deploying National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles after protests against immigration raids.\\n\\nThe governor has also butted heads with Republicans over redistricting. Following the GOP’s unconventional mid-decade redistricting in Texas to boost Republicans’ chances in the 2026 midterms, he pushed California to counter with its own redistricting plan in favor of Democrats. Republican redistricting efforts have since rippled across the country.\\n\\nNewsom was first elected governor in 2018. He previously served as the state’s lieutenant governor and the mayor of San Francisco.\"},\n",

Off the field, Nick\\'s wit, warmth, and unwavering loyalty made him a cherished member of our extended Jets family.\"\\n\\nMangold recently posted a letter on social media that detailed his battle with kidney disease that, \"atter a rough summer,\" required him to undergo dialysis treatments.\\n\\n\"In 2006, I was diagnosed with a genetic defect that has led to chronic kidney disease,\" Mangold wrote in his letter addressed to \"My NY Jets community.\" \"I\\'m undergoing dialysis as we look for a kidney transplant. I always knew this day would come, but I thought I would have more time.\"\\n\\nMangold expressed his gratitude for his family, \"who have been my rock every step of the way. This situation has reminded me how lucky I am to have such an amazing family, friends, and community behind me.\"\\n\\nToday all of those communities Mangold addressed are mourning his passing and remembering No. 74\\'s legacy as a Jets Legend.\\n\\n\"Nick was the embodiment of consistency, strength, and leadership,\" said Jets Vice Chairman Christopher Johnson. \"For over a decade, he anchored our offensive line with unmatched skill and determination, earning the respect of teammates, opponents, and fans alike. His contributions on the field were extraordinary — but it was his character, humility, and humor off the field that made him unforgettable.\"\\n\\nMangold began to bond with the Green & White family as soon as he arrived as the 29th selection of the first round of the 2006 draft out of Ohio State. Combining forces with LT D\\'Brickashaw Ferguson, the fourth selection of that draft, Mangold led the transformation of the Jets\\' O-line into a stable platform that helped produce three playoff teams, including two AFC Championship Game units, and four winning teams from 2006-10.\\n\\n\"A big part of our lives were spent on that field,\" Ferguson said today. \"Then very early on I was at his wedding, there were so many times where we shared life together, family events. I do appreciate having had the opportunity to do life with him, and not only him but his family, everyone else on that stage. ... It\\'s a hard time.\"\\n\\nBeing the rock in the middle of the line was more than just a saying. Mangold stepped into the pivot from day one in \\'06 and snapped the ball to every Jets quarterback until late in the 2016 season. He started and played in every Jets game from \\'06 until early in 2011, 89 games including seven playoff games, until a high ankle sprain sustained early that season against Jacksonville sidelined him for the first time as a pro.\\n\\nTwo games later, he returned to the lineup to start the next 59 games before missing another. In all he started 171 games for the Jets, including those seven postseason contests.\\n\\nMangold was named first-team All-Pro after his 2009 and \\'10 seasons, second-team All-Pro in \\'11, and was voted to the AFC Pro Bowl rosters after the 2008-11 and \\'13-15 seasons. His seven Pro Bowl selections are one shy of the franchise record held by Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Winston Hill, Mangold\\'s Ring of Honor teammate.\\n\\nMangold\\'s induction announcement into the team\\'s Ring of Honor was made June 2, 2022, simultaneously with the announcements of the inductions of Ferguson and CB Darrelle Revis into the Ring. Mangold was honored at his own MetLife Stadium halftime ceremony during Game 3 against Cincinnati on Sept. 25, 2022.\\n\\nLast week, Mangold was among the 52 Modern-Era players who cleared the second hurdle toward becoming a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame\\'s Class of 2026. In about five weeks, that list will be reduced to 25 semifinalists, then to 20 finalists, then to the Hall\\'s four to eight newest members, which will be announced the day before Super Bowl LX.\\n\\nEver since his retirement following the 2016 season, Nick and his famous beard, flowing blond locks and uniform number 74 that he made famous as a Jets player were seen at any number of team and fan events.\\n\\nMangold, a Centerville, Ohio, native, started his Jets journey with the club on Long Island two decades ago, transitioned with the team to New Jersey in 2008 and planted his family\\'s flag down the street.\\n\\n\"Being able to finish out my career here, being able to play for only one team is something really special to me,\" Mangold said last November. \"It\\'s a great team to be a part of. This fan base is as passionate as they come, loyal as all get-out.\"\\n\\nHe was a mainstay on the Jets scene for the past two decades and members of his family and the Green & White community he spoke so fondly of today are mourning the loss of one of the best centers and players and ambassadors in franchise history.\\n\\nBart Scott, the Jets linebacker from 2009-12 during the peak period of Mangold\\'s powers, echoed Ferguson about the connections between teammates that often are as strong and deep as any familial bonds.\\n\\n\"Teammates are the closest thing to family, the tireless hours, the pressure situations and the shared trust and belief,\" Scott said. \"Nick represented the best of us in regard to professionalism, humility and performance. But inclusion was my favorite trait. His ability to see everyone\\'s value and his willingness to meet you where you were at. I\\'ll miss my friend until we meet again.\"\\n\\n\"On behalf of the entire Johnson family and the New York Jets organization,\" Woody Johnson said, \"we offer our sincere condolences to Jenny, their four children — Matthew, Eloise, Thomas, and Charlotte — as well as to Nick\\'s extended family, friends, and all who loved him.'},\n",

       "   'full_content': 'TikTok deal to be finalized Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says - CBS News\\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the TikTok deal announced last month is set to be finalized on Thursday when President Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\r\\n\"We reached a … [+2831 chars]\\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that the TikTok deal announced last month is set to be finalized on Thursday when President Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\n\\n\"We reached a final deal on TikTok. We reached one in Madrid, and I believe that as of today, all the details are ironed out, and that will be for the two leaders to consummate that transaction on Thursday in Korea,\" Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\\n\\nPresident Trump signed an executive order last month that paved the way for a deal to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors. But the details were not immediately clear. Asked about the details of the TikTok transaction Sunday, Bessent said he is \"not part of the commercial side of the transaction.\"\\n\\n\"My remit was to get the Chinese to agree to approve the transaction, and I believe we successfully accomplished that over the past two days,\" he said\\n\\nBessent spoke from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where President Trump began a three-country visit to Asia. Mr. Trump is expected to meet with Xi at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea on Thursday.\\n\\nMr. Trump said last month that Chinese President Xi Jinping had signed off on the deal during a call. The deal represented a \"qualified divestiture,\" satisfying a law passed by Congress in April 2024 that required TikTok\\'s China-based parent company to divest or face a ban. The move also delayed enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for the agreement on the video sharing social media app\\'s operations in the U.S. to be finalized.\\n\\nThe White House outlined last month that the deal would establish a U.S.-based \"joint venture\" made up of a majority of U.S. investors and owners, along with a board of directors with a majority of Americans. ByteDance and its affiliates were set to own less than 20% of the new entity. The White House said a consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)\\n\\nRepublican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" Moolenaar, who previously expressed concern about the TikTok deal, said Sunday that said \"as long as the Chinese are involved, I think there\\'s reason for distrust.\"\\n\\nWhen asked about ByteDance and its affiliates continuing to own up to 20% of the new entity, Moolenaar added, \"I\\'m still concerned about it.\"\\n\\n\"The Chinese report to the Chinese Communist Party, and they will leverage every advantage they get,\" Moolenaar said. \"But the president has set a goal of making this available to the American people, following the law that was passed in a bipartisan way, and I trust that they are doing that.\"'},\n",

Combined income is your adjusted gross income plus any tax-exempt interest and half your Social Security benefit. If you’re married filing jointly and your combined income is between $32,000 and $44,000, you typically would pay tax on up to 50% of your benefits. If your combined income is over $44,000, you would pay tax on up to 85% of your benefits.\\n\\nNormally, a lump sum for back benefits would be taxable in the year it was paid out, but there is an option called the Social Security lump-sum election method, says Mark Luscombe, principal analyst for Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. You can elect to calculate the taxes as if you received the benefits in the year they were due.\\n\\nYou’ll find worksheets in IRS Publication 915 to help with your calculations. Essentially, you’ll determine what portion of the lump sum payment would have been taxable in each prior year. You’ll subtract any previously reported taxable benefits, then add the remainder to your current year’s taxable income, and check line 6c on Form 1040 or 1040SR, Luscombe says.\\n\\nLiz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist for NerdWallet.
