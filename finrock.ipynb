The unprecedented deal was approved by 75% of votes and drew huge applause from the audience at the firm\\'s annual general meeting on Thursday. Musk, who is already the world\\'s richest man, must drastically raise the electric car firm\\'s market value over 10 years. If he does this and meets various targets, he will be rewarded with hundreds of millions of new shares. The scale of the potential payout has drawn criticism, but the Tesla board argued that Musk might leave the company if it was not approved - and that it could not afford to lose him.\\n\\nFollowing the announcement, Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas and danced to chants of his name. \"What we\\'re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" he said. \"Other shareholder meetings are snoozefests but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\" he added. The milestones Musk must achieve over the next decade include: Delivering 20 million Tesla vehicles and one million robots\\n\\nGetting 10 million subscriptions to Tesla\\'s Full Self-Driving feature\\n\\nBringing one million self-driving Robotaxi vehicles into commercial operation\\n\\nEarning up to $400bn in core profit\\n\\nEventually lifting Tesla\\'s overall market value to $8.5tn, currently $1.4tn He won\\'t receive a salary under the agreed deal. But meeting all the above milestones would see him awarded a stock grant of more than 400 million additional Tesla shares - worth around $1tn if the firm\\'s market value is raised high enough.\\n\\nMusk\\'s early remarks on Thursday placed the spotlight on the Optimus robot, dashing the hopes of some long-time analysts and Tesla watchers who want him to focus on reviving the company\\'s electric vehicle business. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an \"autonomous humanoid robot\" performing \"unsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.\"\\n\\nUsing the same artificial intelligence (AI) systems as those powering Tesla vehicles, it has been championed by Musk as central to his firm\\'s future. He\\'s previously said its ability to walk, run and lift items would allow it to play a key role in his factories - and in future, in homes. \"Let it sink in where Musk\\'s head is at,\" wrote analyst Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, on X. \"His vision of the \\'new book\\' starts with Optimus. No mention of cars, FSD and robotaxi yet.\" Later, Musk did refer to FSD, shorthand for full-self driving, saying the company was \"almost comfortable\" allowing drivers to \"text and drive essentially.\" US regulators are investigating Tesla\\'s self-driving feature after multiple incidents, in which the cars drove through red lights or on the wrong side of the road, some resulting in crashes and injuries. Tesla shares were slightly higher in after hours trading but have risen more than 62% over the last six months. Sales have slid in the year since Musk aligned himself with US President Donald Trump - a relationship that disintegrated this past spring. Tesla shareholder Ross Gerber told BBC News that Musk\\'s pay deal marks \"another notch in the unbelievable things that you see in business.\" Musk has made clear his goals for Tesla but the company faces a slew of challenges, including its struggling financial performance, said Mr Gerber, who is the chief executive of investment firm Gerber Kawasaki.\\n\\nReuters Elon Musk will get hundreds of millions of new shares if he hits his targets\\n\\nIt is still not clear if there will be a big demand for humanoid robots, said Mr Gerber. Tesla also faces stiff competition in the robotaxi industry from rivals like Waymo, he added. Mr Gerber said that his company recently lowered its stake in Tesla due to concerns over \"the polarisation of [Musk\\'s] persona\" which has \"demolished the value of the brand\". \"Elon seems to be divorced from the reality that his opinion among the public is so low,\" he said. Wedbush Securities\\' Dan Ives, a tech analyst who has been a long-time advocate of Musk\\'s leadership of Tesla, called him \"Tesla\\'s biggest asset\" in a note published after the vote. \"We continue to believe that the AI valuation is getting unlocked, and we believe the march to an AI driven valuation for TSLA over the next 6-9 months has now begun,\" Mr Ives added.\\n\\nWatch: Elon Musk dances in sync with Tesla robots\\n\\nTesla\\'s challenges run deeper than \\'toxic\\' controversy around Elon Musk Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said it was unclear whether Musk would achieve the targets set out by the company, but highlighted how he \"hit those milestones ahead of schedule\" in 2018. She said his political interests had created some \"polarisation\", but his pay package did not \"put any constraints on his activities\" outside of the company. Musk already held 13% of Tesla shares. Shareholders had twice ratified a pay package worth tens of billions of dollars if he achieved a tenfold increase in the company\\'s market value - which he did. But a Delaware judge rejected that pay deal on grounds that Tesla board members were too close to Musk. Tesla reincorporated from Delaware to Texas, and the Delaware Supreme Court is currently reviewing the lower court judge\\'s decision. The new pay package was rejected by several major institutional investors including Norway\\'s sovereign wealth fund - the world\\'s largest national wealth fund - and the California Public Employees\\' Retirement System (CalPERS) - the biggest public pension fund in the United States. That left Musk more reliant on Tesla\\'s unusually large volume of retail investors. Musk and his brother Kimbal, who also serves on the Tesla board, were both allowed to vote going into Thursday\\'s meeting.\\n\\nReuters Musk said everyone would want an Optimus robot'},\n",

Shelby Knowles | Bloomberg | Getty Images\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday struck landmark deals with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to slash the prices of their blockbuster weight loss drugs. Under the agreements, the monthly out-of-pocket cost of popular injections and upcoming pills could range from $50 to $350 starting next year, depending on the dosage and insurance coverage a patient has, Trump administration officials said. Existing GLP-1s, including Eli Lilly\\'s obesity injection Zepbound and Novo Nordisk\\'s competitor Wegovy, carry list prices above $1,000 a month, which has prevented many patients from taking them. Both companies have introduced lower cost options for people paying in cash and purchasing the drugs directly through their websites. But the deals with Trump, as part of his \"most favored nation\" policy, take those efforts to expand access even further. Here\\'s how much weight loss drugs could cost for patients under the new agreements, based on the details shared so far.\\n\\nMedicare\\n\\nMedicare has covered GLP-1 drugs for diabetes and some other medical conditions: for example, Wegovy for slashing cardiovascular risks. But under the new deals, Medicare will start covering the drugs for obesity for the first time starting in mid-2026, which could allow more seniors to qualify for them and spur more private insurers to cover them. Certain Medicare patients will pay a copay of $50 per month for all approved uses of GLP-1 drugs, including diabetes and obesity treatment. But the Trump administration is putting some constraints on which Medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to receive GLP-1s for obesity and cardiovascular and metabolic benefits. Patients are eligible if they fall into these three cohorts: The first includes those who are overweight — with a body mass index greater than 27 — or with prediabetes or established cardiovascular disease.\\n\\nThe second group is people with obesity – with a BMI greater than 30 – and uncontrolled hypertension, kidney disease or heart failure.\\n\\nThe third group is patients with severe obesity, or anyone with a BMI greater than 35. Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk voluntarily agreed to reduce the prices the government pays for existing GLP-1 drugs already approved for diabetes and other uses to $245 a month, across all non-starting doses. Savings generated by those price reductions will allow Medicare to start paying that same price point for GLP-1s for patients with obesity and a high metabolic or cardiovascular risk.\\n\\nThe agreement will also allow patients to get GLP-1s on direct-to-consumer platforms at steeper discounts than they already receive through drugmakers\\' existing sites. On TrumpRx – the government\\'s direct-to-consumer platform for buying prescription drugs with cash expected to launch next year – the average monthly cost for Wegovy, Zepbound and other injectable GLP-1s will start at $350 and drop to $250 within the next two years, according to senior administration officials. Starting doses of upcoming obesity pills from Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, pending approvals, will be $149 per month on TrumpRx, Medicare and Medicaid. Under the deals announced Thursday, Eli Lilly will get fast-track reviews of its forthcoming pill. Eli Lilly on Thursday said it would lower prices by $50 on its own direct-to-consumer platform, LillyDirect, which already offers Zepbound and other drugs at a discount to cash-paying patients. The multidose pen of Zepbound will be available for $299 per month at the lowest dose, with additional doses being priced up to $449 per month. Eli Lilly\\'s pill, once approved, will be available at the lowest dose starting at $149 per month\\n\\nMedicaid'},\n",

But a photo showed that the sandwich was still in its wrapper on the ground after it hit Lairmore in his bulletproof vest.\\n\\nImages of Dunn became a symbol of resistance to the Trump administration in Washington, with murals popping up on walls depicting a man throwing a sandwich, and with people placing sandwiches in the hands of giant skeletons for Halloween.\\n\\nArtwork depicting former DOJ employee Sean Charles Dunn is displayed on a restaurant wall Aug. 17, in Washington, D.C. Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images\\n\\nSean Dunn told NBC News it was “heartening” to get so much support from his fellow Washingtonians, but that he’s “not comfortable” with the “hero” narrative. Asked if he thought residents — who lack full representation in Congress — were registering their dissent to the federal takeover of the city in finding him not guilty, he said, “Perhaps.”\\n\\nGrand jurors in Washington have rejected several cases against defendants that were brought by the U.S. Attorney\\'s Office for the District of Columbia, which under the Trump administration has been run by two Trump loyalists: first Ed Martin and now Jeanine Pirro.\\n\\n“As always, we accept a jury’s verdict; that is the system within which we function. However, law enforcement should never be subjected to assault, no matter how \\'minor\\'. Even children know when they are angry, they are not allowed to throw objects at one another,\" Pirro said in a written statement.\\n\\nIn closing arguments, defense attorney Sabrina Shroff argued that a sandwich could not and did not cause harm.\\n\\n“This case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is about a sandwich,” she said.'},\n",

Katz/The Virginian-Pilot via AP\\n\\nNEWPORT NEWS, Va. — A jury in Virginia on Thursday awarded $10 million to a former teacher who was shot by a 6-year-old student and later accused an ex-administrator in a lawsuit of ignoring repeated warnings that the child had a gun.\\n\\nThe jury returned its decision against Ebony Parker, a former assistant principal at Richneck Elementary School in Newport News.\\n\\nAbby Zwerner was shot in January 2023 as she sat at a reading table in her first-grade classroom. She had sought $40 million against Parker in the lawsuit.\\n\\nZwerner spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, required six surgeries and does not have the full use of her left hand. A bullet narrowly missed her heart and remains in her chest.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nParker was the only defendant in the lawsuit. A judge previously dismissed the district\\'s superintendent and the school principal as defendants.\\n\\nThe shooting sent shock waves through this military shipbuilding community and the country at large, with many wondering how a child so young could gain access to a gun and shoot his teacher.\\n\\nThe lawsuit said Parker had a duty to protect Zwerner and others from harm after being told about the gun. Zwerner\\'s attorneys said Parker failed to act in the hours before the shooting after several school staff members told her that the student had a gun in his backpack.\\n\\n\"Who would think a 6-year-old would bring a gun to school and shoot their teacher?\" Zwerner\\'s attorney, Diane Toscano, told the jury. \"It\\'s Dr. Parker\\'s job to believe that that is possible. It\\'s her job to investigate it and get to the very bottom of it.\"\\n\\nParker did not testify in the lawsuit. Her attorney, Daniel Hogan, had warned jurors about hindsight bias and \"Monday morning quarterbacking\" in the shooting.\\n\\n\"You will be able to judge for yourself whether or not this was foreseeable,\" Hogan said. \"That\\'s the heart of this case. The law knows that it is fundamentally unfair to judge another person\\'s decisions based on stuff that came up after the fact. The law requires you to examine people\\'s decisions at the time they make them.\"\\n\\nThe shooting occurred on the first day after the student had returned from a suspension for slamming Zwerner\\'s phone two days earlier.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nZwerner testified she first heard about the gun prior to class recess from a reading specialist who had been tipped off by students. The shooting occurred a few hours later. Despite her injuries, Zwerner was able to hustle her students out of the classroom. She eventually passed out in the school office.\\n\\nZwerner testified she believed that she had died that day.\\n\\n\"I thought I was either on my way to heaven or in heaven,\" Zwerner said. \"But then it all got black. And so, I then thought I wasn\\'t going there. And then my next memory is I see two co-workers around me and I process that I\\'m hurt and they\\'re putting pressure on where I\\'m hurt.\"\\n\\nZwerner no longer works for the school district and has said she has no plans to teach again. She has since become a licensed cosmetologist.\\n\\nParker faces a separate criminal trial this month on eight counts of felony child neglect. Each of the counts is punishable by up to five years in prison in the event of a conviction.\\n\\nThe student\\'s mother was sentenced to nearly four years in prison for felony child neglect and federal weapons charges. Her son told authorities he got his mother\\'s handgun by climbing onto a drawer to reach the top of a dresser, where the firearm was in his mom\\'s purse.'},\n",

Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.\\n\\nFor those just joining the story of our interstellar visitor, on July 1 this year astronomers at the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) spotted an object moving through the Solar System at around 58 kilometers per second (36 miles per second). With a lot of telescopes turned towards the object, it was soon determined to be a comet, and a pretty interesting one at that.\\n\\nNow designated 3I/ATLAS, the object is known to be an interstellar comet, which may be a 10-billion-year-old time capsule from another age of the universe. Astronomers are keen to study its properties, which could tell us about the environment it came from, and the effect of the interstellar medium on cometary objects. Besides that, it is only our third confirmed interstellar object, after 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov.\\n\\nUnfortunately, for a while anyway, the object was out of view of Earth telescopes, as it traveled behind the Sun from our perspective. During that time, it was imaged by the European Space Agency’s (ESA) spacecraft Mars Express and ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) from the orbit of Mars.\\n\\nNow, in a small and pretty tasty surprise, China\\'s Tianwen-1 orbiter, which went into orbit around the Red Planet in February 2021, has sent back its own images of the interstellar comet.\\n\\nThe comet can be seen moving in this animated view of several observations. Image credit: CNSA\\n\\nThese images, as you might imagine, are a pretty stunning technical achievement. The cameras onboard Tianwen-1 were originally designed to photograph a well-lit surface of a planet, not a distant and relatively small interstellar comet.\\n\\n\"This was the first attempt to photograph such a distant and relatively dim target (10,000 to 100,000 times dimmer than targets on the Martian surface). Through collaborative efforts of the Tianwen-1 team, combining the orbital characteristics, brightness features, geometric dimensions of Atlas orbit, and the technical capabilities of the orbiter\\'s scientific payloads, repeated simulations and calculations were conducted to complete the feasibility assessment of the observation mission,\" the China National Space Administration (CNSA) explained in a statement.\\n\\n\"The use of the high-resolution camera carried by the Tianwen-1 orbiter was determined, and key imaging strategies were carefully designed, ultimately leading to the successful completion of the observation. This mission maximized the imaging capabilities of the high-resolution camera, specifically targeting the faint target.\"\\n\\nAn image of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS photographed by China\\'s Mars orbiter. Image credit: CNSA\\n\\nSeen in the images are the comet\\'s distinctive traits, including its nucleus – the central icy and rocky part of a comet – and its coma, a cloud of gas and dust which appears as a comet\\'s surface heats and its volatile ices vaporize. There are plenty of interesting puzzles astronomers have observed of this comet, including the development of a rare anti-tail and an unusual chemical makeup.\\n\\nMost recently, the object has apparently changed course slightly and may have lost a significant amount of mass, though these are more signs that the object is a comet outgassing and experiencing a resulting change in acceleration, rather than an alien mothership, a hypothesis rejected by scientists from NASA and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) as unnecessary, given the comet\\'s cometary behavior.\\n\\n\"The images clearly show the comet\\'s distinctive features, consisting of a nucleus and a surrounding coma, with a diameter reaching several thousand kilometers,\" CNSA adds. \"Based on this observational data, researchers are conducting further in-depth studies of ATLAS.\"\\n\\nNow that 3I/ATLAS is back from behind the Sun, Earth\\'s telescopes are pointing at it once again, and hopefully we will learn more about this intriguing object and how it coped with its encounter with the Sun, the first approach to a star it may have had in billions of years. We may soon also have new observations of the comet courtesy of ESA’s JUICE orbiter on its way to Jupiter. Isn\\'t science wonderful?'},\n",

A subsequ… [+2117 chars]\\nApple is turning to Google to make a custom Gemini AI model to power the next version of its virtual assistant Siri for spring 2026, according to a Nov. 2 report by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. A subsequent report on Wednesday states Apple will pay $1 billion per year for this new 1.2 trillion parameter model.\\n\\nApple reportedly was evaluating whether to use Google or AI competitor Anthropic for the next version of Siri. While Apple will pay Google $1 billion per year, it would have cost $1.5 billion per year with Anthropic, according to an earlier Bloomberg report.\\n\\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\\n\\nThis custom Gemini model will run on Apple's private cloud computer servers. Apple's own models will continue to run on devices for personal data, while Gemini will operate on servers for more complex tasks. Apple doesn't plan to highlight Google's involvement in the company's marketing, Bloomberg reports.\\n\\nGoogle declined to comment. Apple and Anthropic didn't respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nWith major tech companies pivoting toward AI, Apple has largely been left behind. The tech company was slow to adopt AI and hasn't developed AI models that are competitive. It instead turned to companies like OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, to help add generative capabilities on top of existing Apple systems.\\n\\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, CNET's parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\\n\\nEven so, the promise of a truly agentic Apple Intelligence has failed to materialize, although it has improved. Apple CEO Tim Cook also hasn't ruled out the possibility of acquiring an AI company.\\n\\nApple also has a close relationship with Google. The search giant pays Apple $20 billion annually to remain the default search engine on Apple devices. It's a relationship that nets Apple money and prevents it from building a competitor to Google Search, a claim Apple denies. This arrangement was a key factor in the Department of Justice's case against Google, in which a judge ruled that the company was operating an illegal monopoly.\\n\\nDespite falling behind on AI, Apple is doing well financially. Last month, it surpassed a $4 trillion market cap.\"},\n",

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\\n\\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\\n\\nMicrosoft AI wants you to know that its work toward superintelligence involves keeping humans “at the top of the food chain.” In a lengthy blog post on Thursday, Microsoft AI head Mustafa Suleyman highlighted the formation of a new team dedicated to developing a “humanist superintelligence” that’s “designed only to serve humanity.”\\n\\nThis kind of superintelligence, according to Suleyman, won’t be “an unbounded and unlimited entity with high degrees of autonomy” and will instead be “carefully calibrated, contextualized, within limits.” Suleyman joined Microsoft last year as the CEO of Microsoft AI, which has only recently launched its first in-house models for text, voice, and image generation.\\n\\nThough Suleyman’s blog post says Microsoft AI will “reject narratives about a race to AGI,” the competition between Microsoft and OpenAI is about to get much more intense. Under a new deal with OpenAI, Microsoft can now “independently pursue AGI alone or in partnership with third parties.” And, as pointed out by my colleague Hayden Field, “Microsoft is perfectly within its legal rights to use OpenAI’s IP to develop its own AGI and attempt to win the race.”\\n\\nBut Suleyman has a vision for “humanist” superintelligence with three main applications, which include serving as an AI companion that will help people “learn, act, be productive, and feel supported,” offering assistance in the healthcare industry, and creating “new scientific breakthroughs” in clean energy.\\n\\n“At Microsoft AI, we believe humans matter more than AI,” Suleyman writes. “Humanist superintelligence keeps us humans at the centre of the picture. It’s AI that’s on humanity’s team, a subordinate, controllable AI, one that won’t, that can’t open a Pandora’s Box.”'},\n",

It later issued more warnings for the towns of Zawtar al-Sharqiyah and Kfar Dounin.\\n\\nThe Israeli military said it targeted military infrastructure for Hezbollah in those areas, including “weapons storage facilities... constructed in the center of civilian-populated areas.”\\n\\nIt accused the group of rebuilding its capabilities almost a year after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect that ended a monthslong war. While most residents evacuated the threatened areas ahead of the strikes, Lebanon’s health ministry reported one person wounded.\\n\\n“We will not allow Hezbollah to rearm themselves, to recover, build back up its strength to threaten the state of Israel,” Israeli government spokesperson Shosh Bedrosian said at a briefing Thursday.\\n\\nThe strikes came as Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam and his government met in Beirut to follow up on a plan drafted by the Lebanese military to disarm Hezbollah and other non-state armed groups in the country. Information Minister Paul Morcos said, following the meeting, that the cabinet “commended the progress (the army) has made... despite continued obstacles, foremost among which is the continuation of Israeli hostilities.”\\n\\nLebanese President Joseph Aoun has been critical of Israel’s strikes and ongoing occupation of five hilltop points on Lebanese territory but has said he is open to negotiations with Israel to end the tensions.\\n\\nAoun said in a statement after Thursday’s strikes that “every time Lebanon expresses its openness to peaceful negotiations... Israel intensifies its aggression.”\\n\\n“Nearly a year has passed since the ceasefire came into effect, and during that time, Israel has spared no effort to demonstrate its rejection of any negotiated settlement between the two countries,” he said. “Your message has been received.”\\n\\nIsrael says its near-daily strikes have targeted Hezbollah officials and military infrastructure, while the Lebanese government that has backed disarming Hezbollah say the strikes have targeted civilians and infrastructure unrelated to the Iran-backed group.\\n\\nThe powerful group’s military capabilities were severely damaged in Israel’s intense air campaign over the tiny country in 2024, but Hezbollah have yet to disarm and its leader Sheikh Naim Kassem has said that the group will be ready to fight no matter how limited their capabilities might be.\\n\\nBoth sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, which nominally ended the latest Israel-Hezbollah war last November. The conflict started after the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel that triggered the war in Gaza.\\n\\nHezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Hamas and the Palestinians, prompting Israeli airstrikes and artillery shelling in return. The low-level exchanges escalated into full-scale war in September 2024.\\n\\nLebanon’s health ministry has reported more than 270 people killed and around 850 wounded by Israeli military actions since the ceasefire took effect. As of Oct. 9, the U.N. human rights office had verified that 107 of those killed were civilians or noncombatants, said spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan.\\n\\nNo Israelis have been killed by fire from Lebanon since the ceasefire. Hezbollah has claimed one attack since the agreement took effect.\\n\\nAlso Thursday, the U.S. Treasury announced a new set of sanctions that it said target “financial operatives who oversee the movement of funds from Iran” to Hezbollah, including through licensed and unlicensed money exchanges shops that it said “fail to conduct adequate screening on their customers” and allow Hezbollah “to take advantage of Lebanon’s largely cash-based economy to launder illicit money.”\\n\\n—-\\n\\nAssociated Press journalist Areej Hazboun in Jerusalem contributed to this report.'}]}"
