       "   'full_content': \"Trump administration asks for emergency pause on judge's order to fully fund SNAP - NBC News\\nThe Trump administration on Friday asked a federal appeals court for an emergency pause on a federal judge's order to fully fund SNAP benefits this month. \\r\\nU.S. District Judge John McConnell ordered… [+2688 chars]\\nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Friday at least temporarily allowed the Trump administration to withhold about $4 billion in payments for the SNAP food benefits program that a federal judge had ordered.\\n\\nThe court, via an order issued by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, provisionally blocked an order issued by Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John McConnell that required the payments to be made by Friday night.\\n\\nThe administration has said that because of the government shutdown, there is only enough money to pay partial benefits this month. It had previously agreed to pay about $5 billion from a SNAP contingency fund but objected to paying another $4 billion from a separate program, arguing McConnell had no authority to force it to.\\n\\nEarlier on Friday, the Agriculture Department had indicated it would make the full payments, according to a memo obtained by NBC News. Patrick Penn, the deputy undersecretary of the Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, informed states that the USDA “will complete the processes necessary” to fully issue SNAP benefits for the time being.\\n\\nMcConnell on Thursday afternoon ordered the administration to deliver full payments to states by Friday, chastising it for delays that he said have likely caused SNAP recipients to go hungry.\\n\\nThe Trump administration unsuccessfully asked the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to immediately block McConnell’s order while that court considers the case in more detail. The administration then turned to the Supreme Court.\\n\\nIn her order, Jackson said a temporary stay was required so that the appeals court can consider the government’s application in full. Jackson is the justice responsible for appeals from the Boston-based appeals court.\\n\\nThat court had said in an earlier order that it intends to act “as quickly as possible.”\\n\\nNearly 42 million people rely on the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.\\n\\nAttorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X Friday: “The Supreme Court just granted our administrative stay in this case. Our attorneys will not stop fighting, day and night, to defend and advance President Trump’s agenda.”\\n\\nThe administration agreed earlier this week to use $4.65 billion in contingency funds to cover about 65% of the benefits that eligible households would ordinarily receive. But it argued that it cannot draw from additional funds set aside for child nutrition programs, known as Section 32 funding, to fully fund SNAP because doing so would take away resources from other programs, like school lunches.\\n\\n“Once those billions are out the door, there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds — to the significant detriment of those other critical social programs whose budgets the district court ordered the government to raid,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in the Supreme Court filing.\\n\\nThe back-and-forth over SNAP funding has persisted for weeks. First, the administration said the funding would not be distributed in November as long as the federal government remained closed. However, the progressive legal advocacy group Democracy Forward challenged that plan in a lawsuit, prompting McConnell last week to order the Trump administration to distribute benefits as soon as possible.\\n\\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said earlier this week that the partial payments were disbursed to states. Since states oversee the process of loading payments onto electronic benefits cards, the Trump administration has argued that it has done its part by authorizing SNAP funding and giving states information to calculate partial benefits for households.\\n\\nHowever, McConnell said Thursday that the administration’s actions did not comply with his order to deliver the payments expeditiously and efficiently.\\n\\n“People have gone without for too long. Not making payments to them for even another day is simply unacceptable,” McConnell said, adding: “This should never happen in America.”\\n\\nThis is the first time SNAP benefits have lapsed because of a government shutdown in the program’s 61-year history. Some families whose EBT cards were due to be reloaded already this week have reported skipping meals or subsisting on the meager foods remaining in their pantries, such as cereal or ramen.\\n\\nWe’d like to hear from you about how you’re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you’re a federal employee who can’t work right now, a person who relies on federal benefits like SNAP, or someone who is feeling the effects of other shuttered services in your everyday life.

       "   'full_content': 'The 2026 Grammy Awards Nominations Are Here - rollingstone.com\\nKendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny, and Lady Gaga lead the pack as the nominees for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards were announced Friday, Nov. 7.\\r\\nAfter winning Song and Record of the Year for “Not Like Us” ea… [+17807 chars]\\nKendrick Lamar, Bad Bunny, and Lady Gaga lead the pack as the nominees for the 68th Annual Grammy Awards were announced today.\\n\\nAfter winning Song and Record of the Year for “Not Like Us” earlier this year, Lamar led all nominees for 2026 with nine, including Album of the Year for GNX. He’ll also compete for Song and Record of the Year again, this time for his hit collaboration with SZA, “Luther.”\\n\\nLady Gaga was right behind Lamar, picking up seven nominations, while Bad Bunny had six. Gaga was nominated in the three big categories — Album, Song, and Record of the Year — for Mayhem and “Abracadabra,” while Bad Bunny picked up his second Album of the Year nod, for DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, as well as his first nod as lead artist for Song and Record of the Year for “DtMF” (he was previously nominated in the latter category for “I Like It” with Cardi B and J Balvin).\\n\\nSabrina Carpenter and Leon Thomas also picked up six nominations each, and both will compete in Album of the Year, too, for Man’s Best Friend and Mutt, respectively. Other nominees in that category include Justin Bieber’s Swag, Clipse’s Let God Sort Em Out, and Tyler, the Creator’s Chromakopia.\\n\\nIn Record of the Year, “Luther,” “Abracadabra,” and “DtMF” will be up against Carpenter’s “Manchild,” Doechii’s “Anxiety,” Billie Eilish’s “Wildflower,” Chappell Roan’s “The Subway,” and Rosé and Bruno Mars’ “APT.” And Song of the Year will boast “Abracadabra,” “Anxiety,” “APT.”, “Luther,” “Manchild,” “Wildflower,” and “Golden,” the breakthrough track from KPop Demon Hunters.\\n\\nRounding out the Big Four categories, Best New Artist is set to feature Olivia Dean, Katseye, the Marias, Addison Rae, Sombr, Thomas, Alex Warren, and Lola Young. (Of those nominees, only Katseye, Thomas, and Young received nominations in other Grammy categories.)\\n\\nLamar will certainly be favored to build off the recent Grammy success of “Not Like Us,” and if he manages to win Album of the Year, GNX will become the first rap album to win the night’s biggest prize since OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below in 2003. The rapper has also found himself on a Beyoncé-level streak of repeated Album of the Year nominations, but no wins: This is his sixth time nominated for the big prize, having earned nods for every solo album he’s released since Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, as well as one for the Black Panther soundtrack LP.\\n\\nEditor’s picks\\n\\nBut some of Lamar’s competitors are equally overdue for an Album of the Year win. Lady Gaga has been nominated for the prize four times before, while this is Bieber’s third time being nominated. Gaga is a highly decorated Grammy winner, with 14 prizes to her name, but she hasn’t yet won a major prize in her career. Similarly, neither has Bieber, though he’s only won two Grammys.\\n\\nFor Clipse, the hip-hop duo’s five nominations are their first in 22 years, having been nominated just once before, in 2003, for their song with Justin Timberlake, “Like I Love You.” And this is Tyler, the Creator’s first time being nominated for Album of Year as a solo artist, having twice won Best Rap Album. The musician also picked up his first nomination in a nonrap category, notching a Best Alternative Album nod for Don’t Tap the Glass.\\n\\nThis could be the year Carpenter or Bad Bunny cement their place as Grammy favorites, with both artists earning a handful of genre prizes over the past few years. Meanwhile, Eilish has once again proven irresistible to Grammy voters, having now been nominated in at least one category every year going back to 2020. The same goes for Bruno Mars, who’s only lost once in his last 15 nominations, going back to 2016.\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\nThis year’s breakout artist is undeniably Thomas, who won a Grammy two years ago, Best R&B Song, for his work on SZA’s “Snooze.” The six nods he picked up this year, however, are his first as a solo following the success of his second LP, Mutt.\\n\\nAs always, there were several major first-time nominees. Protest singer Jesse Welles was nominated in four folk and Americana categories, while Blackpink’s Rosé, country artist Zach Top, and U.K. rocker Yungblud all scored three nominations each. The celebrated singer, songwriter, and producer Dijon picked up his first two Grammy noms, too, though interestingly, they weren’t for his acclaimed album, Baby. Instead, he earned a nod for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical, and is up for Best Rap song for his work on Lamar’s “TV Off.”\\n\\nOther surprises scattered throughout the genre fields include five nominations for Baltimore hardcore favorites Turnstile for their latest LP, Never Enough, as well as four for Paramore’s Hayley Williams for her latest, Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party. Country star Tyler Childers will have another chance to win his first Grammy, earning four nominations for his latest LP, Snipe Hunter.\\n\\nNext year’s Grammys will also see the introduction of a few categories, including Best Album Cover. (Nominees include Tyler’s Chromakopia, Djo’s The Crux, Bad Bunny’s DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS, Perfume Genius’ Glory, and Wet Leg’s Moisturizer.) There will also be some changes to the country category, with the Grammys effectively splitting Best Country Album into Best Contemporary Country Album and Best Traditional Country Album. The latter category features one of the more interesting matchups of 2026, too: Willie Nelson against his own son, Lukas Nelson.\\n\\nThe 68th Grammy Awards are set to air Feb. 1, 2026.\\n\\nSee the

AP\\n\\nThe next day, he posted an explanation to his X account, which has 2.5 million followers and often posts attacks on athletes, politicians, public figures and people he deems “Cracker of the Day.”\\n\\n“I was jumped by multiple individuals who tried to steal my jewelry and cause physical harm to me,” he wrote. “Contrary to some video circulating, Police temporarily detained me until they received my side of the story and then released me. I WENT HOME THAT NIGHT AND WAS NOT ARRESTED. I will be talking to my legal council and attorneys on pressing charges on the individuals that jumped me.”\\n\\nHe faces a maximum 15-year prison sentence and up to a $10,000 fine if convicted on the second-degree murder charge.\\n\\nOver his 12-year NFL career, Brown posted 928 receptions for 12,291 yards and 83 touchdowns, though in later years, he often made headlines for off-the-field issues.\\n\\nHe’s faced multiple lawsuits over the years, including a 2019 incident for throwing furniture out of a 14th-floor window. In 2020, he pled no contest to felony battery and burglary after an incident with a truck driver. Brown has also been accused by multiple woman of sexual assault and domestic violence.\\n\\nIn 2023, he claimed to be suffering from CTE, a neurodegenerative disease that can cause behavioral issues, but has yet to be diagnosed in a living person.'},\n",

The orcas, mostly females and juveniles, were unusually energetic and seemed to be forcefully pushing the newborn toward the surface, which worried the team on the boat at first.\\n\\n\"We observed them carrying the calf on their back and holding it above water for air,\" Balotay wrote. \"I was not sure if it was alive.\"\\n\\nScientists with the Norwegian Orca Survey, a research and conservation organization, flew a drone above the orcas to take a closer look.

The calf was alive and well. (Image credit: Krisztina Balotay)\\n\\nFootage from the drone showed that the calf had struggled to stay afloat for the first 15 minutes after birth, but that it was alive and well after that.\\n\\n\"The mother was identified as NKW-591, a known female first identified in 2013,\" the representatives wrote. \"She has had multiple offspring and is therefore an experienced mother.\"\\n\\nThe calf\\'s dorsal fin was bent, but this is to be expected in the hours after a newborn emerges from the womb, Balotay noted in Orca Channel\\'s post. \"It was so amazing to watch something like this in the wild,\" she added.\\n\\nThis is the first documented case of an orca being born in the wild and of its first hour alive, Norwegian Orca Survey representatives wrote on Facebook. The team followed the orcas until darkness fell, maintaining a distance of more than 1,000 feet (300 meters) so as not to disturb the animals. \"We also ensured the whales\\' space was protected by stopping additional boats from approaching,\" they said.\\n\\nThe Norwegian Orca Survey hope they will encounter this orca group and the calf again in the coming weeks.

The lake\\'s waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit — hotter than most spa baths.\\n\\nTheir findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations\\' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.\\n\\n\"You couldn\\'t put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil\\'s Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.\\n\\nHe recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.\\n\\nResearchers from the Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development recover a dead dolphin from Tefe lake, which flows into the Solimoes River, affected by high temperatures and drought, in Tefe, Amazonas state, Brazil, October 3, 2023. BRUNO KELLY / REUTERS\\n\\nIt\\'s an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.\\n\\nWhile this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.\\n\\nIn all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.\\n\\nThe most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.\\n\\nAccording to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nOfficials from the World Wildlife Fund Brazil said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130 pink dolphins and 23 tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.\\n\\n\"The climate emergency is here\"\\n\\nWhat made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.\\n\\nUsing computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity — a measure of water haziness.\\n\\nThese factors reinforce one another.

Elise Stefanik, a close Republican ally of President Donald Trump, announced Friday that she’s running for governor of New York, a place she depicted in a campaign launch video as being “in ashes” because of lawlessness and a high cost of living.\\n\\nIn her video, a narrator declares “The Empire State has fallen” as it paints a grim picture of urban, liberal leadership and life in New York City, though the message appeared to be aimed at audiences in other, more conservative parts of the state.\\n\\nHer candidacy sets up a potential battle with Gov. Kathy Hochul, a centrist Democrat, though both candidates would have to first clear the field of any intraparty rivals before next November’s election.\\n\\nStefanik, 41, has teased a run for months, often castigating Hochul, 67, as the “worst governor in America.” She’s also assailed Hochul for endorsing the ascendent, democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, now the mayor-elect of New York City.\\n\\nIn a written statement, Stefanik said she is running to make “New York affordable and safe for families all across our great state.”\\n\\n“Our campaign will unify Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to Fire Kathy Hochul once and for all to Save New York,” she said.\\n\\nHochul’s campaign released its own attack ad Friday against the Republican, dubbing her “Sellout Stefanik,” and blamed her for enabling Trump’s tariffs and federal funding cuts to education and health care.\\n\\n“Apparently, screwing over New Yorkers in Congress wasn’t enough — now she’s trying to bring Trump’s chaos and skyrocketing costs to our state,” said Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika.\\n\\nRepresenting a conservative congressional district in northern New York, Stefanik had once been a pragmatic and moderate Republican who would avoid uttering Trump’s name, simply calling him “my party’s presidential nominee.”\\n\\nBut in recent years she has reshaped herself into a brash disciple and ardent defender of Trump’s MAGA movement, rising through the ranks of the Republican Party’s congressional hierarchy as it molded to Trump’s political style.\\n\\nLast year, Stefanik was tapped to become the president’s ambassador to the United Nations, though her nomination was later pulled over concerns about her party’s tight margins in the House. She then began to angle toward a run for governor, and very quickly got a public nod of support from Trump.\\n\\nHer announcement video, which was titled “From the Ashes,” casts New York as a dangerous place plagued by “migrant crime” and economic crisis, placing the blame on “Kathy Hochul’s failed policies,” as urgent, ominous music plays in the background.\\n\\nNew York City police officials have long touted drops in crime and this week said the city is in its eighth consecutive quarter of major crime decline.\\n\\nThe Republican primary field remains unclear ahead of the 2026 race.\\n\\nOn Long Island, Republican Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman has said he’s weighing a run for governor. In a statement Friday, he said he has “tremendous respect” for Stefanik but that the GOP needs to nominate a candidate who has “broad based appeal with independents and common sense Democrats.”\\n\\n“The party must nominate the candidate with the best chance to defeat Kathy Hochul and I have been urged by business, community and political leaders across the state to make the run and I am seriously considering it,” said Blakeman, who handily won reelection to another four-year term on Tuesday.\\n\\nU.S. Rep. Mike Lawler had been contemplating a run but instead decided to seek reelection in his battleground House district in the Hudson Valley.\\n\\nHochul faces a contested primary, with her own lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, running against her.\\n\\nDemocrats have a major voter registration edge in New York. The state’s last Republican governor was former Gov. George Pataki, who left office about two decades ago.\\n\\nStill, Republican Lee Zeldin, a former Long Island congressman and current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, made a serious run for the office in 2022, coming within striking distance of upsetting Hochul. ___\\n\\nAP writer Philip Marcelo contributed to this report.'},\n",

Netflix posted footage of the pair laughing and joking together in front of crowds and media before the launch of the fifth and final season of the hugely successful sci-fi series in Los Angeles. It comes after the Mail on Sunday reported that Brown had filed a \"harassment and bullying claim\" against Harbour before filming began last year. Asked at the premiere about working with him, she told Extra: \"It\\'s been amazing, we\\'re so lucky to have each other, the show means so much to both of us, to everyone here.\"\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\nHarbour told Entertainment Tonight: \"I adore her, I\\'ve been proud to watch all of them grow up to become such great artists. \"I doubt it\\'ll be the last time we\\'ll work together...

And we\\'re proud of the fact that we did so.\" He added: \"I\\'ve read a bunch of stories and they range from wildly inaccurate to... there\\'s so much noise around it. But the truth is that we view this crew and this cast as family, and so we treat each other with respect, and that\\'s always been bedrock.\"\\n\\nGetty Images Left-right: Sadie Sink, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Noah Schnapp and Millie Bobby Brown were at the premiere\\n\\nStranger Things is one of Netflix\\'s most popular shows of all time. Brown plays Eleven, gifted with superpowers she uses to battle supernatural forces terrorising the inhabitants of Hawkins, Indiana. Harbour, as Jim Hopper, takes on a fatherly role to protect her, which can cause tensions between their characters as she tries to lead as normal a life as she can with her friends. The new series, which also stars Winona Ryder, mostly takes place 18 months after the end of season four, although the forthcoming launch episode will take viewers back to six days before Will Byers, one of the children in Hawkins, first went missing. The first four episodes will be available in the US from 26 November, with the next three arriving on Christmas Day, and the finale on New Year\\'s Eve.

At Live Science we\\'re a passionate bunch who love reading the latest research and how new discoveries are changing the world around us. We\\'re also lucky enough to write and report on it every day. But we are just a small bunch of humans , and to paraphrase the late, great Douglas Adams\\' \"Hitchhiker\\'s Guide to the Galaxy,\" science is big. Really big. You just won\\'t believe how vastly hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. While we cover the most important or interesting topics of the day, there is no way we can report on it all, not even using AI (and we are very clear about how we use it . TL;DR — we don\\'t). So rather than letting good news pass both you and us by, why not share it in one place? That way you can let our experienced journalists filter through the noise and bring you the latest science news that matters, wherever it comes from, often with their own spin on things. Obviously you\\'ll read the best of Live Science here as soon as it\\'s published, but that will sit alongside everything else that matters: Whether it\\'s a scientist voicing their thoughts on a controversial study, another publication\\'s insight into how health research is being impacted by government policy, or a roundup of the latest science news from across the web. So remember to stay curious and check back every day for good science.

If you didn\\'t get enough chills and thrills from the Halloween weekend, take a peek at this video of one researcher gently pressing on the spongy web with his bare hand. I\\'ll keep my desk job, thanks.\\n\\nNASA gets a new boss Isaacman testifying during a Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee confirmation hearing on April 9, 2025 (Image credit: Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) For all those who haven\\'t left for good because of the spiders, let\\'s return to space — well, space policy — with news that President Trump has renominated Jared Isaacman as the new NASA chief. Isaacman, a billionaire and key Elon Musk ally, has been setting Washington abuzz all week with a leaked memo that outlines plans to outsource some of NASA’s missions and treat the agency like \"more of a business,\" Politico reports. Trump initially put Isaacman’s name forward to lead the agency in December 2024, but his nomination was abruptly pulled during a public feud with Musk earlier this year.\\n\\nWhat does falling into a black hole feel like?

Yeah, I sometimes have bad days too, but that’s rather beside the point for this fascinating excerpt from science writer and physicist Jonas Enander’s new book \" Facing Infinity: Black Holes and Our Place on Earth, \" which takes us step-by-step through the gory yet fascinating ordeal.\\n\\nMove over 3I, there\\'s a second Comet ATLAS in town A photo of C/2025 K1 (ATLAS) snapped by astrophotographer Dan Bartlett. (Image credit: Dan Bartlett) We\\'ve been so engrossed in coverage of 3I/ATLAS that we nearly failed to note another comet currently in Earth\\'s skies. This one is called C/2025 K1 (ATLAS), or the \"other ATLAS,\" and it survived a near-doomed passage around the sun to emerge as a beautiful golden ribbon . The exact reason for this comet’s gold coloration is unclear, but astronomers think it could have something to do with its relatively low ratio of gas to dust. Studying it could give scientists some more clues into the conditions in the Oort cloud, the mysterious shell of icy objects at the edge of our solar system where the comet was born.\\n\\nSo long 1.5 C People cooling off under high sun at a cooling pad in Toronto. (Image credit: Steve Russell/Toronto Star via Getty Images) Hi everyone, it\\'s Patrick , Trending News Writer, here taking the blog baton from Ben. One of the big science stories circulating as of yesterday (Nov. 4) is that the United Nations has announced Earth will speed past humanity\\'s 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) climate change target. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) report found that global average temperatures will likely exceed 1.5 C of warming before 2035, and reiterated calls to slash greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere. In 2015, world leaders signed the Paris Agreement , an international treaty that promised to limit global warming to preferably below 1.5 C and well below 2 C (3.6 F). The findings of the latest report highlight world leaders\\' failure to address climate change, but its findings are not unexpected. Ben covered a report in June that found greenhouse gas emissions could exhaust Earth\\'s \"carbon budget\" in as little as three years, while last month, I covered a similarly grim report documenting record carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) increases . The new report comes as many world leaders prepare for the U.N.\\'s COP30 climate summit in Brazil next week — for reference the Paris Agreement was adopted at COP21. Climate scientists often stress that it\\'s not too late to reverse course and prevent further warming.

(Image credit: PEDRO PARDO/AFP via Getty Images) Harry Baker , one of Live Science\\'s Senior Staff Writers, has just penned (okay, typed) a story about three Chinese astronauts (taikonauts) who are now stranded in space after their return capsule was struck. The culprit? A suspected piece of \"space junk\" that hit the capsule just hours before its planned departure earlier today, forcing taikonauts Wang Jie, Chen Zhongrui and Chen Don to extend their time aboard China\\'s Tiangong space station. Officials are still investigating exactly what happened. It\\'s currently unclear how much damage the debris caused or when the three taikonauts, who have been living on the space station since April 24, will be able to return home.\\n\\nCan AI be creative? Do we even want it to be? A robot using a typewriter. (Image credit: Getty Images/Moor Studio) Us humans are pretty proud of our creativity — for centuries we’ve cited our ability to make paintings, compose symphonies , and write poetry (or nowadays really, really good posts) as the key traits that distinguish us from other animals. But what happens to that self-applied definition if it turns out that artificial intelligence (AI) can do all of those things too? And will that day ever come, or are the machines simply parasitizing our creativity? This fascinating Nature news feature sought answers .\\n\\nMaya ruin was actually a gigantic cosmogram Archaeologists found a cross-shaped area at the Aguada Fénix site in Mexico. (Image credit: Takeshi Inomata) Or perhaps we should hold off on the AI creativity thinkpieces until we find a chatbot that can do this. Archaeologists have published a new study suggesting that Aguada Fénix, a 3,000-year-old site in what is now southeastern Mexico, was actually a gigantic representation of the Maya people’s cosmology . Working together to build the 5.6 by 4.7 mile (9 by 7.5 kilometer) site may have been a celebrated communal activity, the researchers suggest, similar to the construction of Stonehenge.\\n\\nJames Webb Space Telescope \\'eclipse maps\\' an extremely distant planet A series of light wavelength observations for WASP-18B, the first alien planet to ever be 3D-mapped. (Image credit: Challener et al. / Nature Astronomy) How do you create the first-ever map of a planet that’s 400 light-years away? You use a really good telescope, let’s say the James Webb Space Telescope , that’s so sensitive it can measure the tiny changes in light reflected across a planet’s surface as it\\'s eclipsed by its star. Then you piece all of those changes together until you create a complete 3D representation. If it sounds fantastical, it very much is. But scientists actually did it and you can read all about it here .\\n\\nBye until tomorrow! We\\'re signing off now, but we\\'ll be back in the morning with more science news.

The largest supermoon of the year rose last night, so I thought I\\'d start by sharing a nice image story. BBC News has a roundup of some stunning lunar snaps taken last night.

(Image credit: Narvikk via Getty Images) The climate change news is coming thick and fast this week as world leaders prepare for the U.N.\\'s COP30 climate summit starting in Brazil on Monday (Nov. 10). One of the big topics heading into this year’s summit is tipping points — potential \"points of no return\" within key Earth systems beyond which lasting changes to the environment occur. I\\'ve put together an explainer with everything you need to know about Earth\\'s tipping points, which include the collapse of polar ice sheets, thawing of carbon-trapping permafrost and widespread forest dieback. The thing I found most alarming about tipping points is that, because we can only detect them on longer timeframes, we may have already passed some. But on the bright side, climate scientists maintain that we can still avoid the worst impacts of climate change; we just have to cut emissions — simple, right? Check out the full story here .

(Image credit: Quantinuum) What do you do after building the world’s most powerful quantum computer ? Use it to unlock the secrets of room-temperature superconductors , of course. That’s at least the plan according to a fresh announcement by Quantinuum , a $10 billion company that claims to have made the world\\'s most powerful quantum processing unit. Equipped with 98 physical qubits made of barium ions, the machine, called Helios, can supposedly crunch through specialist problems it would take a traditional supercomputer the total wattage of a jet-spewing black hole to solve. The researchers set Helios to simulate aspects of the Fermi-Hubbard model — a framework that may yield clues into making room-temperature superconductors a reality. It could all be revolutionary if it pans out. But stay seated, it definitely isn’t our first rodeo when it comes to superconductor hype . (Quantinuum’s setup is, in fairness, incomparably more sophisticated than the DIY setups of LK-99 hobbyists .) Ben Turner Acting Trending News Editor\\n\\nOver and out We\\'re off.

The new digital map of the Roman road network. (Image credit: Itiner-e) Good morning science fans. Trending news writer Patrick here to kick off another day of blog coverage. I want to start with a story about roads. Hear me out. Researchers have created a new map of the Roman Empire, revealing that the Roman road network was twice as large as previously thought. The researchers made their discovery by looking at smaller, unnamed roads, and not just the main highways to and from the capital. So how big does the new atlas reveal the Roman Empire to have been around its maximum extent in A.D. 150.? Nearly 186,000 miles (300,000 km), stretching from Europe to the Near East and North Africa. You can read the full story here and explore the map for yourself on Itiner-e . Patrick Pester Trending News Writer\\n\\nJapan has a bear problem An asian black bear standing in the forest. (Image credit: Getty Images) Japan has deployed its military to help deal with a rise in bear attacks, NPR reported yesterday (Nov. 6). Bears have killed a record-breaking number of people in Japan this year, and there are now almost daily reports of people encountering brown bears and Asiatic black bears, as the animals search for food before hibernation. The Japanese military says that soldiers won\\'t be shooting bears, but will assist in trapping and logistics. Japanese authorities have recorded at least 12 fatal bear attacks this year, the highest toll since records began in 2006. Researchers say that climate change is disrupting the bears\\' food supply, forcing them to search for food in more populated areas. Japan\\'s population is also aging, and it has fewer trained hunters than in years past. For more details on Japan\\'s bear problem, including how the country is using \"Monster wolf\" robots to deter predators, check out this visually immersive story from Reuters, published last year.

Switching to daylight saving time has long been associated with various acute medical conditions. Should it be scrapped entirely? (Image credit: Peter Cade via Getty Images) Hello! Staff Writer Sophie Berdugo here. I\\'m writing this post as I watch the sun already start to set from the window of my home office in London. In fact, earlier this week, I performed my yearly ritual of trying to find where on Earth I stored my Seasonal affective disorder (S.A.D.) lamp back in March. The transition between daylight saving time and standard time hits hard every year, and I reported on one recent study showing it could even have severe health effects for some . It turns out that the majority of Live Science readers don\\'t like switching between the two time policies either — only 4% would choose to stick to the current system. Have a glance at how your fellow readers feel about the biannual clock change , and let us know in the comments what you think. Sophie Berdugo Staff Writer\\n\\nAurora Borealis?

The shots protect against diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and mumps, which once plagued children and their parents.\\n\\n\"When I was a kid, my parents were terrified about my catching polio or measles or whatever. And friends of mine died,\" says Dr. Stanley Plotkin, a veteran vaccine scientist who is now 93 and a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania.\\n\\n\"A parent today very likely does not worry about his or her child dying of an infectious disease,\" he adds.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nThat\\'s because routine childhood vaccinations have largely vanquished many diseases, making vaccines one of medicine\\'s greatest triumphs.\\n\\nBut Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has long questioned the safety and effectiveness of many vaccines. And President Trump recently called for big changes in how children get vaccinated.\\n\\n\"They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies it\\'s a disgrace. I don\\'t see it. I think it\\'s very bad,\" Trump said recently at a White House event. \"It looks like they\\'re pumping into a horse.\"\\n\\nSo a powerful Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee hand-picked by Kennedy is now scrutinizing the childhood vaccine schedule. The schedule is the finely calibrated timetable pediatricians use to administer the sequence of more than 30 doses to protect against more than a dozen diseases.\\n\\nThe move is being welcomed by some advocates, physicians and scientists.\\n\\n\"I think it is true that any vaccine schedule should periodically be assessed,\" says Dr. Ofer Levy, a vaccine scientist at Harvard. \"As we like to say, \\'Moses did not come down from Mount Sinai saying: \\'This will be the only way that you immunize.\\'\"\\n\\nBut others worry the review is part of Kennedy\\'s campaign against vaccines.\\n\\n\"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has for 20 years been an anti-vaccine activist and science-denialist. You would have hoped that when he was confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services he would have taken on his job, which is to protect the health of children in this country. But he didn\\'t,\" says Dr. Paul Offit, who runs the Vaccine Education Center at the Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia. \"All he cares about is making vaccines less available, less affordable and more feared.\"\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nFederal officials did not respond to NPR\\'s questions about a possible overhaul of the childhood vaccine schedule.\\n\\nThe scrutiny is especially troubling to many public health authorities, coming amid new outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough . These are on the rise because of falling immunization rates.\\n\\nOffit and others say every vaccine is meticulously evaluated before being added to the schedule. And researchers and regulators continually monitor all vaccines.\\n\\n\"All the data and evidence suggest that our vaccine schedule is incredibly safe and incredibly effective,\" Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Stanford University. \"In fact, it is probably the most effective vaccine schedule in the world.\"\\n\\nKids get this roster of shots at a young age to make sure they don\\'t catch dangerous diseases when they\\'re most vulnerable, Maldonado and others say.\\n\\nSome people who are worried about vaccines argue the number of different antigens and other ingredients could overwhelm a child\\'s immune system. But babies\\' immune systems can handle it, says Maldonado and other scientists. Children are exposed to far more stimulation naturally from microbes than from vaccines. And vaccines have been refined over the decades to minimize the number of ingredients they contain.\\n\\nThere are about 170 different components in the various shots in today\\'s vaccine schedule, Offit says, which is \"actually less than the vaccines that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I got as children of the early 1950s,\" Offit says.\\n\\nExperts are especially alarmed that the CDC is investigating splitting up the MMR vaccine, which protects kids against measles, mumps and rubella in one shot. Giving kids three separate shots would mean more trips to the doctor and more needles, vaccine proponents like Offit say. They worry that, inevitably, more kids would end up missing vaccines. And it would take years to develop new individual shots, according to the proponents.\\n\\nSponsor Message\\n\\nDr. Jesse Goodman, a vaccine expert at Georgetown University who used to regulate vaccines at the Food and Drug Administration, says: \"It\\'s as if you had this really winning football team and you said, \\'Well, gee, we\\'re winning. We win every season. We win every game. Let\\'s change everything we\\'re doing.\"'},\n",

(Photo By: Mark Bonifacio/NY Daily News via Getty Images) NY Daily News via Getty Images\\n\\nBig Apple billionaire John Catsimatidis planned to move his business to New Jersey if Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor. Now he’s reconsidering.\\n\\nNew York City supermarket billionaire John Catsimatidis went nuclear in June, when Zohran Mamdani, who had proposed opening a cheap city-run grocery story in each of the five boroughs, won the democratic primary for mayor. Catsimatidis held a press conference with Bodega owners; publicly threatened to shut down his 30-plus stores if the democratic socialist won the election; and ranted on TV. “He’s not qualified... this is silly,” he said on FOX News, comparing Mamdani to Fidel Castro. “It’s one big con game.”\\n\\nHe also called President Trump, who publicly backed his friend. “[Mamdani] actually wants to take over the grocery stores of John Catsimatidis, who’s a great guy, a rich guy,” Trump said of his buddy, whose net worth Forbes pegs at $4.8 billion, “He actually called me the other day, he’s concerned his stores are going to be taken from him, and they won’t be run like John runs them, believe me, he runs a good operation.”\\n\\nNow that Mamdani has been elected, Catsimatidis is once again agitating. “I think a lot of business people are reducing their exposure to New York City,” he tells Forbes. Catsimatidis—whose $7.8 billion (revenue) Red Apple Group also owns a Pennsylvania oil refinery, some 400 convenience stores and a portfolio of real estate stretching from New York to Florida—had been looking to move Red Apple’s headquarters to New Jersey if Mamdani became mayor. He changed his mind after Tuesday’s election. “New Jersey didn't go the right way,” he says—after the state resoundingly elected Democrat Mikie Sherrill as governor. Now, he’s looking for “friendly states” to relocate operations, with Florida being the most likely candidate. “The key word is a common sense place to do business in,” explains Catsimatidis.\\n\\nThe nearly lifelong New Yorker, who immigrated to the city from Greece at six months old, dropped out of New York University his senior year to open the first Red Apple grocery store in 1971. Within four years, Catsimatidis had ten stores and was making $1 million a year. Today, Red Apple Group, which acquired Gristedes supermarkets in 1986 and recently gained a controlling share in D'Agostino stores, says it’s the largest supermarket chain in New York City, with most of its stores in Manhattan.\\n\\nMamdani’s plan to set up city-sponsored stores – which would be exempt from paying rent or taxes, would partner with farmers and small businesses to offer groceries at wholesale prices and with no plans to make money – is in response to soaring food costs. “Whether you are…a single mom still waiting for the cost of groceries to go down, or anyone else with their back against the wall. Your struggle is ours, too,” he said in his victory speech Tuesday night.\\n\\nMORE FOR YOU\\n\\nCatsimatidis claims it’s also his struggle. “We don't have any profit margins,” he says, explaining that his stores have been losing money for “at least two years.” He blames the state of the city: “Shoplifting is up to an all-time high. A lot of stuff is being closed up, which means that it's not easy for people to shop, so sales are down.”\\n\\nCatsimatidis, who employs a few thousand people, hasn’t decided how his business will respond if city-run stores undercut its prices, but says he’s “sure” he will need to reduce its workforce. “Can you imagine a tax-free supermarket that pays no commercial rent tax, no sales tax… I mean, how do you compete against that?,” he says. “You can’t fight city hall.”\\n\\nCatsimatidis ran for mayor in the 2013 Republican primary but lost the nomination to Joe Lhota who then lost the race to democrat Bill de Blasio. “The way things are right now, we pay taxes on our taxes. I mean, it's out of control,” he says, “No wonder people are yelling and screaming that prices of food are too high.”\\n\\nWhile he threatens to relocate, Catsimatidis still has a soft spot for the Big Apple: “I just hope he keeps the quality of life going in the city and does not cut the New York Police Department down.”\"},\n",

And GTA+ continues to grow its membership. In fact, it\\'s had 20 percent growth year-over-year. And GTA 5 has sold in more than 220 million units.\"\\n\\nJust to put that figure into perspective, the entire population of Brazil is estimated to be roughly 213m people, according to Worldometer. Brazil is no slouch either, being the 7th largest country in the world by population. It\\'s safe to say with those figures in mind, Take Two isn\\'t exactly in dire waters right now.\\n\\nStill, the delay of GTA6 is a blow against the industry giant. Take Two\\'s stock took a tumble following news breaking about the new release date. Meanwhile, protests were held outside Rockstar Games and Take Two\\'s UK offices due to the sudden firing of staff looking to unionise.

    "DeepSeek releases DeepSeek-R1, an open-source AI model outperforming OpenAI at lower cost\n",
    "The Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has launched its new reasoning AI model, DeepSeek-R1, under an open MIT license. This model has surpassed OpenAI's o1 in several benchmarks for math, coding, and reasoning. With an impressive 671 billion parameters, R1 is accompanied by six smaller, distilled versions that range down to 1.5 billion parameters, enabling them to operate on local devices.\n",
    "The DeepSeek-R1 family includes various models, such as DeepSeek-R1-Zero, which uses reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning, and six compact models with parameter sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 70 billion. The model employs a mixture-of-experts structure, optimizing performance and cost efficiency.\n",
    "Remarkably, DeepSeek-R1 was developed at a much lower cost than OpenAI’s o1, with API access starting at $0.14 per million tokens, significantly lower than OpenAI's $7.50 for the same tier. This makes R1 a cost-effective alternative, undercutting OpenAI’s unlimited o1 access priced at $2,400 annually through ChatGPT Pro. By releasing its models as open-source, DeepSeek aims to democratize access to advanced AI, and challenge established players like OpenAI with its cost-effective and high-performing models.\n",
