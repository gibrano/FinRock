       "   'full_content': 'Lions vs. Buccaneers live updates: Score, highlights, analysis for \\'MNF\\' - CBS Sports\\nWhat was supposed to be an offensive shootout turned into a 17-point first half, with the Lions jumping out to a 14-3 lead at the break.\\xa0\\r\\nAmon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs provided a spark for the … [+1368 chars]\\nIf the Detroit Lions were looking to make a statement Monday night, they certainly accomplished that.\\n\\nDetroit put together a dominant defensive showing against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a convincing 24-9 victory, holding Tampa Bay to just 252 total yards and nine points -- the third-lowest total for the Buccaneers under Baker Mayfield in his three years as their starting quarterback.\\n\\nThe Lions limited Tampa Bay to 3.9 yards per play and forced punts on the Buccaneers\\' first five possessions. Tampa didn\\'t score until its eighth drive, completely shut down by Detroit\\'s relentless defense.\\n\\nJahmyr Gibbs fueled the Lions\\' offense with a career night, finishing with 218 total yards and two touchdowns from scrimmage. Gibbs ripped off a 78-yard touchdown run -- the Lions\\' longest play in 14 years -- while totaling 17 carries for 136 yards and three catches for 82 yards. Detroit finished with 379 yards of offense and 5.9 yards per play despite a missed field goal, a turnover on downs, a fumble and an interception.\\n\\nJahmyr Gibbs\\' historic night\\n\\nJahmyr Gibbs DET • RB Att 87 Yds 390 TD 4 FL 0 View Profile\\n\\nGibbs delivered one of the greatest individual performances by a running back in Lions history. His 218 scrimmage yards were the most by a Lions player in a game since Calvin Johnson\\'s 329 in 2013, and he became the first Lion since Kevin Smith in 2011 to record 200-plus scrimmage yards and two rushing touchdowns in a single game.\\n\\nHere was all Gibbs accomplished on Monday night:\\n\\nFirst Lions player with 200-plus scrimmage yards and two touchdowns in \"Monday Night Football\" history\\n\\nLongest rushing touchdown (78 yards) by a Lions player since Jahvid Best in 2011\\n\\nTied for the most touchdowns by a Lions player through his first 39 career games (38) since 1970 -- matching Barry Sanders\\n\\nThis was all with Sanders in attendance by the way.\\n\\nBuccaneers struggle with Lions\\' pressure\\n\\nBaker Mayfield TB • QB • #6 CMP% 66.2 YDs 1539 TD 12 INT 1 YD/Att 7.89 View Profile\\n\\nThe Lions certainly had a goal to pressure Baker Mayfield on Monday night, and they were able to take advantage of the Buccaneers\\' quarterback. Mayfield was just 9 of 13 for 62 yards when pressured, throwing an interception and finishing with a 47.6 passer rating. Mayfield was sacked twice, and the Buccaneers committed two turnovers when pressured, as the Lions\\' defense disrupted the tempo of Tampa\\'s passing attack.\\n\\nThe Buccaneers went scoreless on their first seven possessions, punting on the first five before Sterling Shepard\\'s fumble and Mayfield\\'s interception. They were down 14-0 at that stage of the game and should have been down more if not for a Goff fumble, a Goff interception and a Jake Bates missed field goal.\\n\\nEven with the Lions\\' miscues, Detroit still had control of the game because of the pressure it created on Mayfield. The Lions had four sacks and eight quarterback hits in the game.\\n\\nPrime-time savants\\n\\nThe Lions improved to 13-3 in prime-time games under Dan Campbell, winning five straight on \"Monday Night Football\" -- the longest streak in team history. They have gone 51 straight games without back-to-back losses, the longest streak in franchise history. Detroit does have a prime-time loss this season but is 2-1 in prime-time matchups.\\n\\nThe opposite holds true for Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers are 1-7 in prime-time games with Baker Mayfield as their quarterback, compared to 23-10 in all other games. This was the Buccaneers\\' first prime-time game of the season, and Tampa Bay has two more currently on the schedule (at Rams, vs. Falcons).\\n\\nPlayoff implications\\n\\nWith the Buccaneers\\' loss, the Packers (4-1-1) are the No. 1 seed in the NFC. Tampa Bay (5-2) falls from the No. 1 seed to No. 4, while Detroit moves from No. 7 to No. 5 with the win. The Lions trail the Packers by one game in the loss column in the NFC North, while the Buccaneers lead the Panthers by one game in the NFC South.\\n\\nUp next\\n\\nThe Lions (5-2) have their bye week before hosting the Vikings in Week 9. The Buccaneers (5-2) travel to New Orleans to face the Saints in Week 8 before their bye week.'},\n",

Some services such as AWS Config, Redshift, and Connect continue to have a backlog of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours.”\\n\\nOct 20 3:53 PM PDT Between 11:49 PM PDT on October 19 and 2:24 AM PDT on October 20, we experienced increased error rates and latencies for AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region. Additionally, services or features that rely on US-EAST-1 endpoints such as IAM and DynamoDB Global Tables also experienced issues during this time. At 12:26 AM on October 20, we identified the trigger of the event as DNS resolution issues for the regional DynamoDB service endpoints. After resolving the DynamoDB DNS issue at 2:24 AM, services began recovering but we had a subsequent impairment in the internal subsystem of EC2 that is responsible for launching EC2 instances due its dependency on DynamoDB. As we continued to work through EC2 instance launch impairments, Network Load Balancer health checks also became impaired, resulting in network connectivity issues in multiple services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudWatch. We recovered the Network Load Balancer health checks at 9:38 AM. As part of the recovery effort, we temporarily throttled some operations such as EC2 instance launches, processing of SQS queues via Lambda Event Source Mappings, and asynchronous Lambda invocations. Over time we reduced throttling of operations and worked in parallel to resolve network connectivity issues until the services fully recovered. By 3:01 PM, all AWS services returned to normal operations. Some services such as AWS Config, Redshift, and Connect continue to have a backlog of messages that they will finish processing over the next few hours. We will share a detailed AWS post-event summary.\\n\\nPREVIOUSLY at 2:48 p.m. PT: Access is has returned to many sites that were interrupted this morning by a massive Amazon Web Services outage.\\n\\nWatch on Deadline\\n\\nAWS indicated in a post that, as of 2:48 p.m. PT, throttling of traffic had been restored to “pre-event” levels. “There is a backlog of analytics and reporting data that we must process and anticipate that we will have worked through the backlog over the next two hours,” the statement read.\\n\\nRead it in full below.\\n\\nOct 20 2:48 PM PDT We have restored EC2 instance launch throttles to pre-event levels and EC2 launch failures have recovered across all Availability Zones in the US-EAST-1 Regions. AWS services which rely on EC2 instance launches such as Redshift are working through their backlog of EC2 instance launches successfully and we anticipate full recovery of the backlog over the next two hours. We can confirm that Connect is handling new voice and chat sessions normally. There is a backlog of analytics and reporting data that we must process and anticipate that we will have worked through the backlog over the next two hours. We will provide an update by 3:30 PM PDT.\\n\\nPREVIOUSLY at 8:10 a.m.: Hundreds of websites and apps that went offline temporarily in North America and Europe on Monday morning following an outage at an Amazon Web Services data center in North Virginia appeared to be functioning as normal as the U.S. woke up.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, Amazon Services such as Amazon Music, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa went down or suffered slowdowns, alongside messaging apps such as Signal, WhatsApp and Snapchat as well as entertainment and game sites including IMDb, Disney+, Fortnite, Roblox and Wordle among many.\\n\\nIn its latest update at 7.29 a.m. PT related to the data center outage, AWS, which provides cloud services to thousands of businesses worldwide, said the situation was improving but gave no reason for the cause of the problem.\\n\\n“We have confirmed multiple AWS services experienced network connectivity issues in the US-EAST-1 Region. We are seeing early signs of recovery for the connectivity issues and are continuing to investigate the root cause,” read the message.\\n\\nIn the backdrop, e-commerce experts said that the resumption of connectivity was just one part of the story, warning that Monday morning’s outage would likely have longer-term consequences for businesses operating on the web.\\n\\n“When AWS sneezes, half the internet catches the flu. Outages like this cause frustrated users but also trigger a domino effect across payment flows,” said Monica Eaton, founder and CEO of e-commerce services provider Chargebacks911 and Fi911.\\n\\n“What I expect now is a spike in ‘I never got my service’ or ‘I was charged twice’ claims. Many of those won’t be fraud, just confusion. But confusion is the No. 1 driver of chargebacks. If merchants sit back and wait for disputes to roll in, they will bleed revenue unnecessarily.”\\n\\nShe urged online businesses to get ahead of the curve by running duplicate charge sweeps, pushing out proactive notifications to affected users and issuing prompt refunds to impacted customers.\\n\\n“The outage will end long before the disputes do. Any business that treats this as a one-day incident is already behind. Downtime happens, but silence and slow responses are what cause real damage.”\\n\\nIsmael Wrixen, CEO of digital commerce platform ThriveCart, said the outage should serve a wake-up call for all operators in the space.\\n\\n“Today’s outage isn’t just an ‘East Coast AWS’ problem; it’s a reminder that 100% uptime is a myth for everyone. The internet runs on shared infrastructure,” he said.\\n\\n“The real story isn’t just that AWS had a critical issue, but how many businesses discovered their platform partner had no plan for it, especially outside of U.S. hours. This is a harsh wake-up call about the critical need for multi-regional redundancy and intelligent architecture.”\\n\\nPREVIOUSLY, 1:50 a.m.: Hundreds of online services went temporarily offline across North America and Europe on Monday amid suggestions that the problem was linked to an outage at an Amazon Web Services data center in North Virginia.\\n\\nAlongside Amazon services such as Amazon Music, Prime Video and Amazon Alexa a slew of other websites and apps also suffered problems, including Signal, Life360, Roblox, Zoom, Fortnight, IMDb, and Disney+ among many.\\n\\nThe issue appeared to be linked to a severe outage at an AWS facility in North Virginia, but it has yet to be confirmed if this is the sole cause of wider issues, which were reported both in North America and Europe.\\n\\nAWS first reporting “increased error rates and latencies for multiple AWS services” just after midnight PT, with its latest message at 1.26 a.m. PT, saying the issue was ongoing.\\n\\n“We can confirm significant error rates for requests made to the DynamoDB endpoint in the US-EAST-1 Region,” read the message.\\n\\n“This issue also affects other AWS Services in the US-EAST-1 Region as well. During this time, customers may be unable to create or update Support Cases. Engineers were immediately engaged and are actively working on both mitigating the issue, and fully understanding the root cause. We will continue to provide updates as we have more information to share, or by 2:00 AM.”\\n\\nAravind Srinivas, CEO of Perplexity AI, was one of the first to point to the AWS outage at the cause of the problem, with a post on X saying: “Perplexity is down right now. The root cause is an AWS issue. We’re working on resolving it.”\\n\\nThe issue first started hitting the news as people woke up in Europe to discover a number of websites and apps were not working.\\n\\nMonitoring sites such as Downdetector started to report a spike in issues for multiple sites and apps at around 8 a.m. UK time (midnight PT).\\n\\nBeyond entertainment and media sites, a number of banking sites were also impacted including the UK’s Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Bank and Halifax as well as cryptocurrency site Coinbase. The latter put out a statement saying all funds were safe.\\n\\nThe incident has echoes of an outage at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike in July 2024, which impacted 8.5 million Windows devices worldwide, disrupting airlines, banks and government services at an estimated cost of $10 billion overall.\\n\\nThe exact cause of the outage has yet to be ascertained.'},\n",

A Colombian citizen also survived the attack and remains hospitalized after being repatriated to that country.\\n\\nU.S. military personnel rescued both men after destroying the submersible on Thursday. Trump said on social media that U.S. intelligence confirmed the vessel was carrying “mostly fentanyl and other illegal drugs.”\\n\\nThere is little evidence to indicate that fentanyl is produced in the Andes, as the vast majority of it flows into the U.S. through Mexico.\\n\\nTrump said that two people on board were killed, and the two survivors were being repatriated to their home countries “for detention and prosecution.”\\n\\nThe attack on the submersible was at least the sixth of its kind since September. A seventh that occurred Friday, was reported over the weekend, bringing the total deaths from the attacks to at least 32. The strikes have set off tensions in the region, particularly between Trump, Venezuela and Colombia, once one of the American government’s tightest allies in the Western Hemisphere.\\n\\nThe Colombian government said its survivor “will be prosecuted according to the law” for alleged drug trafficking. It noted that the man was seriously wounded.\\n\\nColombia’s government said Monday that it had recalled its ambassador to the United States following an increasingly angry back-and-forth between its president, Gustavo Petro, and Trump over the strikes.\\n\\nTensions increased Sunday when Trump called Petro “an illegal drug leader” and “a lunatic” after Petro accused the U.S. government of killing a Colombian citizen in a Sept. 16 strike on a boat the U.S. said was allegedly carrying drugs.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Ecuador’s conservative president, Daniel Noboa, said Monday in a message on X addressed to his U.S. counterpart: “President Trump, Ecuador remains firm in the global fight against drug trafficking.” He added that such challenges “require unity among nations committed to peace and prosperity.”\\n\\nTrump has justified the actions, saying the United States is engaged in an “armed conflict” against drug cartels.\\n\\nHe has relied on the same legal reasoning used by the George W. Bush administration when it declared war on terrorism after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. It includes the authority to capture and detain combatants and use lethal force to eliminate their leaders.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press journalist Astrid Suárez in Bogota, Colombia contributed to this report.'},\n",

The bright green Comet Lemmon (C/2025 A6) will pass by Earth within 56 million miles, while Comet Swan (C/2025 R2) will come even closer to Earth, at roughly 24 million miles, according to Space.com.\\n\\nThe weather in New Jersey should be generally clear tonight and into tomorrow morning, according to the National Weather Service. NOAA forecasts clouds and showers should dwindle before tonight\\'s sunset in New Jersey, and thanks to gusty winds, lingering moisture and threats of fog will dissipate.\\n\\nHere\\'s what to know about the two rare comets, how to spot them, timing, and more.\\n\\nWhat comet is visible tonight?\\n\\nComet Lemmon, named C/2025 A6 Lemmon, and Comet SWAN, named C/2025 R2 Swan, are expected to shine bright tonight, Oct. 20, and Tuesday, Oct. 21, 2025. However, Lemmon\\'s spookiest approach will come around Halloween 2025, when it could shine its brightest around Oct. 31-Nov. 2, according to Starwalk.\\n\\nLemmon has reached a magnitude +6 on the detection limit of the human eye, which technically means it could be seen without a telescope or binoculars, if the sky is perfectly dark. Lemmon was first discovered in January 2025 by the Mount Lemmon Survey, which uses a 60-inch telescope at Mt. Lemmon, Arizona.\\n\\nComet SWAN was first discovered in September 2025 by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory\\'s SWAN instrument.\\n\\nWhen is Comet C/2025 A6 Lemmon visible?\\n\\nComet Lemmon is inbound and is making a close approach Oct. 21, 2025 (the new moon) but will brighten even more near Halloween 2025 and through early November. NASA says while it\\'s tough to predict the brightness of comets, estimates say Lemmon will be best seen in the evening sky near bright stars like Arcturus in Boötes by looking northwest after sunset.\\n\\nTo spot it, first find when the sun sets at your location. Then, head out about 90 minutes after with a pair of binoculars or a telescope, and look toward the northwest. You\\'ll notice each night it\\'ll be making a climb northward.\\n\\nThe next time Comet Lemmon will make its closest approach is in about 1,150 years, so don\\'t wait!\\n\\nWhen is Comet C/2025 R2 Swan visible?\\n\\nComet SWAN, or C/2025 R2 Swan, is also visible in the evening sky, but in the southwest. SWAN is slightly dimmer, although recent observations put it on a brightness magnitude of 5.6, meaning it may be visible to the naked eye as very faint object in the dark night sky.\\n\\nSWAN is best position for observers in the Southern Hemisphere, so it might be trickier to spot than Lemmon. On Oct. 16, SWAN was positioned about 5 degrees to the upper left of the star Xi Serpentis, in the eastern section of the constellation Serpens.\\n\\nTo spot it, look in the hours following sunset, before it sinks low on the south-southwest horizon. Use a stargazing app, like Stellarium, to find the comet.\\n\\nWhere to look, how to see the comets?\\n\\nBeginning tonight, Oct. 20, skywatchers will want to find a spot with a good view of the horizon, away from city lights. Unlike stars and planets, comets often have diffuse comas and long, faint tails that can span a significant portion of the sky. For that reason, using lower magnification on your equipment works best.\\n\\nWhen will Halley\\'s Comet appear next?\\n\\nAll this comet talk has stirred interest in Halley\\'s Comet, the most famous of all comets that appears twice in a human lifetime. Halley\\'s Comet is expected to appear again around July 28, 2061, according to Space.com. Right now, Comet 1P/Halley is in the constellation of Hydra, known as the \"female water snake\" constellation close to the celestial equator.\\n\\nWhen did Halley\\'s Comet last appear?\\n\\nHalley\\'s Comet last appeared February 1986, although it was the worst possible viewing circumstances for Earth observers being that it was out of sight and on the opposite side of the midwinter sun. However, midsummer 2061 promises a much better view — at least 10 times brighter, Space.com says.\\n\\nLori Comstock is a New Jersey-based journalist with the Mid-Atlantic Connect Team.'},\n",

The only option on the entire 13-man pitching staff who won’t be is Logan Gilbert, who surrendered five runs (four earned) in four-plus innings in his Game 6 start. Woo said that he came out of his first relief appearance in Game 5 feeling fine and “good to go” if needed, though the Mariners would’ve preferred to use him in a closer contest than their 6-2 loss on Sunday night. If and when he and Miller are deployed, they’ll likely be done so for a clean inning rather than with traffic. Those spots will be for Andrés Muñoz, Matt Brash, Gabe Speier and Eduard Bazardo. Unless Kirby is completely lights out, look for it to again be an all-hands-on-deck effort, much like in Seattle’s 15-inning win in ALDS Game 5 vs. Detroit.'},\n",

It’s not yet clear what the object is or where it came from, but officials said it’s probably a spent rocket part.\\n\\n“The debris is likely a propellant tank or pressure vessel from a space launch vehicle,” the Australian Space Agency wrote in a post on X.\\n\\nThe agency did not provide details about the object’s size or weight, but wrote that it is working with local authorities and other space agencies to investigate and determine “the exact nature of the debris and its origin.”\\n\\nThe agency did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for further information.\\n\\nThe object was discovered Saturday on a remote access road by workers from a nearby mine, according to a report from Sky News, which said that local authorities did not think the debris posed any threat to public safety. NBC News has not independently confirmed these details. (Sky News is a division of Comcast, the parent company of NBC News.)\\n\\nGovernment space agencies and private space companies often let depleted or defunct rocket parts and satellites burn up in the atmosphere as a way to destroy them. Sometimes, however, pieces can survive the fiery process of atmospheric re-entry. Still, it’s relatively rare for space debris to fall over land, given that the planet is mostly covered by oceans — and even more rare for pieces to fall over densely populated areas.\\n\\nIn recent years, though, experts have raised concerns about the growing problem of space debris, particularly as launches into orbit have become more frequent.\\n\\nLast summer, a 90-pound slab of space debris was discovered on a mountain trail in North Carolina. It was later identified as part of the service module from a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule that had carried four astronauts back to Earth from the International Space Station earlier that year.\\n\\nIn March 2024, a 1.6-pound piece of metal tore through a home in Naples, Florida. A subsequent investigation found that the metal debris came from a cargo pallet that had been intentionally released from the International Space Station to burn up in the atmosphere.\\n\\nTens of thousands of pieces of space junk — and millions more smaller bits of orbital debris — are cluttered in low Earth orbit, the narrow band of space where many telecommunications and GPS satellites circle the planet. These objects fly through orbit at up to 18,000 mph, threatening functioning spacecraft and posing safety risks to astronauts on the International Space Station.\\n\\nFor those reasons, experts have long warned against overcrowding in space. NASA and other space agencies have even funded research into and technology demonstrations of how to clean up the large amount of junk in orbit.\\n\\nThe Australian Space Agency said on X that it “is committed to the long-term sustainability of outer space activities, including debris mitigation and continues to highlight this on the international stage.”\"},\n",

This woman’s a saint. I’m just heartbroken for her right now.”\\n\\nJohn went on call Mossimo a “terrible narcissist” and claimed that Lori “put up with a lot over the years [with] this guy.”\\n\\nHe then brought up the 2019 college admissions scandal where Lori and Mossimo were both sent to prison for allegedly paying to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Bella into the University of Southern California.\\n\\n“I really tried to be there for her during this time and also with the college scandal… I’m not going to debate whether she had much to do with it or not. I know she didn’t,” John said before alleging that Mossimo “dragged [Lori] through that.”\\n\\n“She’s not a liar. She’s a saint,” John said of Lori, before recalling that when he called to check in on her the day the scandal broke, she told him, “Mossimo handles all that stuff.”\\n\\nJohn also claimed that Lori appeared to not have any idea of what was happening before they were arrested.\\n\\n“She goes to f–king prison for this a–hole for three months, right? And he goes for whatever,” John said. “And in typical Lori fashion, I said, ‘How was it?’ She goes, ‘You know, I met a lot of nice ladies in there. We have a book club.’”\\n\\nJohn went on to allege, “She didn’t deserve to be dragged through that. … I know for a fact it was all him. … I don’t think Olivia wanted to go to college. I can’t speak for her, but it seems like she was doing great with her YouTube and [makeup].”\\n\\nWhen asked about Lori and Mossimo‘s separation, John once again fiercely defended his former co-star.\\n\\n“All of a sudden they’re split up and I know she’s just devastated,” John said. “For a girl who, you know, has lived her life really well, [is] a good person, a good mother, a good wife. I know all this for a fact. To be thrown into, now, this separation and exploding, blowing up her family this way. And I just hate to see her go through this.”\\n\\nJohn then said that he was “taking a fifth on that” when asked about the rumors that Mossimo cheated on Lori.\\n\\n“Whatever he did to her, it busted her up to the core,” he added.\\n\\nJohn also said that Lori was “an angel” who “always made things better” for Mossimo.\\n\\n“She cleaned everything up,” he added.\\n\\nYou can find out more about Lori and Mossimo‘s split here.'},\n",

On Monday morning, they were allowed to return. Google is performing additional inspections at other Google campuses in New York, including buildings at the company’s Hudson Square campus, “out of an abundance of caution,” the email says.\\n\\nThe company advised employees to submit a report “if you experience symptoms you believe are linked to possible bedbug exposure.” Additionally, “if you suspect you’ve seen a bedbug onsite,” employees were told to report the sighting to the facilities team. Employees were also told to contact professional exterminators if they found bedbugs in their home.\\n\\nGot a Tip?

With the satellites added to the constellation Sunday, the company has delivered more than 10,000 mass-produced Starlink spacecraft to low-Earth orbit.\\n\\nThe exact figure stands at 10,006 satellites, according to a tabulation by Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist who expertly tracks comings and goings between Earth and space. This number includes dozens of Starlink demo satellites, but not the dummy spacecraft carried on SpaceX’s recent Starship test flights.\\n\\nThe Starlink network surpassed 7 million global subscribers in August, primarily beaming Internet connectivity to homes and businesses. SpaceX is now aggressively pushing to broaden its service direct to smartphones.\\n\\nThe first two Starlink prototypes, named Tintin A and Tintin B, launched in 2018 as pathfinders. SpaceX began launching Starlink satellites with a radically different design in 2019, initially flying 60 satellites at a time.

Investment in mining and processing: The Participants will mobilize government and private sector support including for capital and operational expenditures via guarantees, loans, or equity; finalization of offtake arrangements; insurance; or regulatory facilitation. Project selection: The Participants will jointly identify projects of interest to address gaps in priority supply chains. Financing: In addition to the steps above, within 6 months of the date of this Framework, the Participants are taking measures to provide at least $1 billion in financing to projects located in each of the United States and Australia expected to generate end product for delivery to buyers in the United States and Australia. Investment support: The Participants will work together to develop new or bespoke mechanisms to strengthen critical minerals and rare earths supply chains. Ministerial: The Participants have decided to promote investment in mining by convening a Mining, Minerals and Metals Investment Ministerial within 180 days of the date of this Framework. Permitting: The Participants are taking measures to accelerate, streamline, or deregulate permitting timelines and processes, including to obtain permits for critical minerals and rare earths mining, separation, and processing within their respective domestic regulatory systems, consistent with applicable law. Price Mechanisms: The Participants will work to protect their respective domestic critical minerals and rare earths markets from non-market policies and unfair trade practices, including through the adoption of standards-based systems in which those who adopt the standards can trade freely and within a pricing framework including price floors or similar measures. The Participants will also work with international partners to develop a future global framework to deal with associated international pricing challenges. Asset Sales: The Participants commit to work in good faith to develop new or strengthen existing authorities and diplomatic tools that review and deter critical minerals and rare earths asset sales on national security grounds. Scrap: The Participants commit to investing in minerals recycling technology and to work together to ensure management of critical minerals and rare earth scrap that supports supply chain diversification. Third parties: The Participants will work together with third parties as appropriate to ensure supply chain security and utilize existing engagement mechanisms. Geological mapping: The Participants will cooperate to assist in mapping mineral resources in Australia, the United States, and elsewhere as mutually determined, to support diversified critical mineral supply chains. Rapid Response: The Participants are establishing a U.S.-Australia Critical Minerals Supply Security Response Group under the leadership of the U.S. Secretary of Energy and the Australian Minister for Resources to identify priority minerals and supply vulnerabilities and develop a coordinated plan to accelerate delivery of processed minerals under this Framework.\\n\\nSection II\\n\\nGeneral Provisions\\n\\nThe appropriate authorities of the Participants will carry out post-project analysis and implementation. The specific content of the post-project analysis is to be developed between/among the Participants, in accordance with their respective domestic laws. The Participants will meet, virtually or in-person, at the written request of the other Participant within 10 days of the receipt of the request. Either Participant may discontinue its participation in this Framework by giving written notification to the other Participant. Absent notice to the contrary from the discontinuing Participant, any such discontinuation would be effective on the thirtieth day after the date of receipt of the written notification by the other Participant. The Framework sets out a policy and programmatic action plan that does not constitute or create rights or obligations under domestic or international law, does not give rise to any legal process, and does not constitute or create any legally binding or enforceable obligations, express or implied.\\n\\nSigned in Washington, District of Columbia this twentieth day of October, two thousand and twenty-five.\\n\\nFor the Government of the For the Government of Australia:\\n\\nUnited States of America:\\n\\nDonald J.

It would be awarded in 12 tranches as Musk hits each goal laid out in the proposal.\\n\\n$1 trillion\\n\\nTesla estimated the value of the shares at $87.8 billion while ISS values them at $104.4 billion. Using Tesla’s lower valuation, the ultimate value for Musk would exceed $1 trillion if all market capitalization goals are reached.\\n\\n“Full achievement of the market capitalization milestones requires historic growth of approximately $7.5 trillion (as of the grant date) to reach the final $8.5 trillion target,” the ISS report said. “This would result in higher market cap than that of Tesla’s largest current competitors in the AI space combined… If all of the shares are ultimately delivered and the highest market cap milestone is achieved, the potential value of those shares is more than $1 trillion.”\\n\\nMusk’s pay package combines operational goals with market value milestones. The first goal involves delivering 20 million vehicles while hitting a $2 trillion market valuation. More goals include obtaining 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, delivering 1 million “AI robots,” putting 1 million robotaxis in operation, and achieving a $400 billion adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).'},\n",

       "   'full_content': 'Nearly 90% of adults are at risk for this condition, but most have never heard of it, survey finds - CBS News\\nAbout 9 in 10 adults in the United States have not heard of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome despite nearly 90% of adults being at risk for the condition, according to a recent survey from th… [+2844 chars]\\nAbout 9 in 10 adults in the United States have not heard of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome despite nearly 90% of adults being at risk for the condition, according to a recent survey from the American Heart Association.\\n\\nCardiovascular-kidney-metabolic syndrome, or CKM syndrome, is a disorder caused by the connections between heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes and obesity. The syndrome, which was defined by the AHA for the first time in October 2023, reflects how these conditions can influence or worsen each other.\\n\\n\"The health conditions were previously considered separate problems and are often managed separately. With this new designation, the AHA wants people to understand that the conditions are closely connected,\" Mass General Brigham explains.\\n\\nTo diagnose CKM syndrome, providers will test different risk factors, to determine your stage from 0 to 4, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Stage 0 means no risk factors; Stage 1 means you have excess body fat; Stage 2 means you have a condition such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney disease; Stage 3 means you have heart disease without symptoms or a high risk of it; and Stage 4 means you have heart disease with symptoms, extra body fat and risk factors for diabetes or other metabolic conditions. Stage 4 could also include kidney disease.\\n\\nAccording to a study published in JAMA last year, nearly 90% of U.S. adults have at least one risk factor for CKM syndrome, which include the following:\\n\\nHigh blood pressure\\n\\nAbnormal cholesterol\\n\\nHigh blood sugar\\n\\nExcess weight\\n\\nReduced kidney function\\n\\n\"The interplay of these risk factors increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and heart failure more than any one of them alone,\" the AHA said in a news release about its survey.\\n\\nChanges to eating habits and physical activity can help prevent CKM syndrome, AHA and other experts say.\\n\\nIn a 2023 interview with CBS New York, cardiologist Dr. Nidhi Kumar said 33% of Americans have three or more risk factors that contribute to this syndrome.\\n\\n\"When we think of danger in medicine, sometimes people think of the words \\'cancer\\' or \\'COVID,\\' but chronic diseases, like those that make up CKM, are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States,\" Kumar said.\\n\\nDr. Eduardo Sanchez, the American Heart Association\\'s chief medical officer for prevention, said in a statement that it\\'s important for people to know it\\'s common to have heart, kidney and metabolic risk factors at the same time.\\n\\n\"It is reassuring that once the CKM connection was defined nearly three-quarters of those responding understood that it was important and wanted to learn more,\" Sanchez said about the AHA survey.\\n\\nThe Cleveland Clinic adds, \"researchers are hoping for a future where everyone gets holistic treatment for CKM syndrome instead of treatment for one body system at a time.\"\\n\\nThe Harris Poll conducted the survey, which included about 4,000 U.S. adults, in August 2025 on behalf of the association.'}]}"
