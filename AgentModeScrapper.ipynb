      "  \"content\": \"The Wall Street Journal reports that the White House is in advanced talks with Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, on a pricing arrangement that would make certain GLP-1 weight-loss medicines available for about $149 per month in some cases. The discussions—part of a broader push by the Trump administration to lower high-profile drug prices—could also encompass Eli Lilly’s rival GLP-1 drugs, with an announcement expected as soon as this week if terms are finalized. The emerging framework would expand lower out-of-pocket options beyond current cash offers (such as recent $499 or time-limited promotional prices) and may be paired with a limited Medicare pilot that allows coverage for specific medical indications where these drugs are already permitted (for example, diabetes for semaglutide products and sleep apnea for Zepbound), while not broadly authorizing coverage strictly for weight loss. The article situates the talks after President Trump’s Oct. 16 remarks previewing a $150 target for Ozempic, followed by officials cautioning that negotiations were ongoing. It notes the potential public-health impact of wider access, the ongoing IRA-driven Medicare price talks for semaglutide products, and recent market volatility in Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly shares tied to pricing headlines. Final details—eligible drugs, which patients qualify, distribution channels (direct-to-consumer/telehealth or retail pharmacy), and the duration of discounts—remain under negotiation.\",\n",
